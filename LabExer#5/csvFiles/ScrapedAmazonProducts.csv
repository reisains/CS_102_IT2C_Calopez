"7","Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Cozzzy Fuzzy Sandals Slide","Very Comfortable Shoes","marey","I bought each of my daughters a pair of these for Christmas. I was sure about them when I ordered them, I didn't know if they would like them, they are in their early 20's. When I received them I tried them on and fell in love with them. I told my girls if they didn't like them that I would keep them and get them something else. They absolutely loved them. They are very comfortable and warm, they have a thick enough bottom that you can wear them as a regular shoe or slippers in the house. My feet get too hot with regular lined Crocs so these are perfect for me being open toe. So if course I bought myself a pair. Don't be thrown off by the looks, they are very comfortable and come in a ton of different colors.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"25","Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Cozzzy Fuzzy Sandals Slide","Comfy","Girl_stuff","I injured my heel on a hike, but these have a broad, slightly platformed base with enough cushion and flex that I can walk and stand more comfortably, without pain, in them.This biack/white marble look has 90s appeal and they’re very practical. Really cute with jeans, simple slip dresses, pajamas and casual or sports wear. The price is fair. I might get some coordinating jibbitz for fun - or another pair.Reviewers and Crocs suggested I size up - I even measured my feet per their site instructions. My normal size is 10, every indicator said 10 - but these in 10 are a bit roomy for me.- so if I wear thin socks, they’ll be about right. The liner is comfy in reducing rub, but I think the sandal will last longer than the liner.I’m probably a 9 or would be a 9.5 if they made half sizes. My feet have high arches and they’re regular - just slightly narrow in width.They don’t slide on hardwood or linoleum, so the bottom tread is impressive.Super easy to get in and out of.This pair I received is well made, no frayed threads or or irregularities.I like how they’re warm but breathable.I’m expecting to wash them in mild dish liquid and warm water then towel and air dry before combing the liner when they’re dirty. Eventually I might remove the liner (though I would miss it).If I didn’t have high arches, were senior, living in a wet climate, recovering from an injury or worked in one of the fatiguing foot industries from travel to healthcare to kitchens - I’d consider Crocs. My foot injury has given me a serious appreciation for them. I just wish they had arch support so I could wear them more. They’re a recovery, in and around the house slipper right now.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"66","Crocs Unisex Adult Mellow Recovery Slide","Wide feet, don’t size down","B","I followed the suggestion to size down and got 1 size down from my regular, but I have wide feet and they were a bit tight. The length was right, but they are tight enough to be annoying. I think crocs will stretch and form to my feet a bit, plus they are sold out of my size, otherwise I would exchange for my regular size.This was my concern, as is always with all shoes lol, but seeing several reviews say they even went down 2 sizes, plus crocs design I thought it was going to be spot on. A bit sad, but I want to keep these sandals because they are otherwise comfy and cool as hell.Edit: I’ve worn them a couple weeks now and they are straining my big toe but I’m hoping that is the size being too small, my regular size is in stock and I’m hoping the fit is perfect. As of now, they are too tight for my foot to stay in the right place so walking outside is uncomfortable. They do squeak a lot and make my feet sweaty but I do prefer wearing socks most of the time anyway. But the size down has really caused problems.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"74","Crocs Unisex Adult Mellow Recovery Slide","Comfort and value awesome, size down but....","Cristina","So the comfort and value on these are awesome. Feels good to walk in for your daily home movement (nothing like exercise). I was told you need to size down since they run big. Got a 12 (I wear 13) and I feel like certain aspects are not like a normal fit. Toes and top of foot fit good but the heel seems very crammed (narrow). I am guessing because it is built as a size 12. I also noticed the slipper wants to slip out when doing extended walking. Of course that is my experience...I do wear a size 13...could use a size 13.5 in some fits. My foot is not exactly narrow but not wide.

Size down one. I normally wear a 7 had to get a 6. All that said, comfy, smooshy, relaxing shoe. The outsized sole is a little awkward until you get used to it but the arch is great. I purchased the pink clay. I will say it is an odd color but very neutral. It is not a bright pink and really does look the same color as a pink clay face mask.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"78","Crocs Unisex Adult Mellow Recovery Slide","Squishier ""self-care"" sole- stylish","swathi singh","The sole has less support than the classic comfort line, but not completely without support. They are as advertised- best as post workout shoes. I'll keep looking for an everyday shoe but these are amazing after long hours in work boots. Look great.Size: sized down 8w to 7w. I wish they had half sizes as band stretches with use.Fit: nothing digs, cuts, or rubs badly. Band hits top of foot just right. Toes framed well. I'm a narrow foot and wish it was a bit tighter but it isn't falling off by any means.Style: lovely and nonchalant vibes dress up or down easily. Color is great- pigmented but neutral enough to be versatile.Seriously I love these!!Typically wear 7.5-8, narrow foot, high arch","Reviewed in the United States on 2 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"86","Crocs Unisex Adult Mellow Recovery Slide","If not perfect, give it time","Nana T","The soles of these really are more comfortable than traditional Crocs (which are already comfy). These definitely feel like an end of the day slide. The top is pretty large and thick, so it takes a bit of time for it to conform to your feet, but it is starting to shape nicely. A benefit of the width of the top is that it does provide great support. I would absolutely love in these if the top sat back from the toes just a bit more to allow additional wiggle room. As I said, they do break in, I would just really like that area to not taper so much.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"164","Crocs Unisex Classic Sandal","Sounds Good","Leon Pelletier","My usual size is 48 Merrell/Columbia or 49 Ecco/Adidas. I had to pick up size 51. I knew I had to pick up such size because of a previous experience. Once I bought 48/49 croocks sandals but it was way too tight back then. I think when it comes to sandals, one should by conventiom take one size beyond his usual shoe size. The slides size sticker tag actually showed 50/51. And on the sole its molded 15. I have wide feet. And it perfectly fits my foot width. It's a bit too long of 1cm/1,5 cm in the back and front of my foot but I will overcome the prejudice. Unless it's inherent to any pair of sandals. Pretty sure If I ever purchased 49/50 it wouldn't have been a good fit: probably would have been too tight. The crocs logo is actually attached with a sort of a clips. I removed both of them in a second and throw them away.

These are a great alternative for my sore feet and a nice break to wear indoors from my regular orthotic sandals. I have Morton’s Neuroma on my left food and these don’t seem to agitate it at all. They aren’t the best for long use, but give my feet a break from super stiff soles. For a regular foot, they would be good too.

They don't slip about when you're walking and you don't have to tense your feet up to hold them on (which can be painful when you have shoes that do that to you). They aren't particularly my taste to look at but they're not horrible either.

It would have been nicer if the inside of the shoe was softer or smoother, making the shoe comfortable. They fit very snug around the base mouth of the shoe. The size chart is too true to fit.

They fit perfectly and I know an 8 would have been too big. I have narrow feet though, so if you're between sizes with a wide foot, I'd look for a different review or do whatever you normally do or order both and return one.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I was simply looking for comfort in a lime yellowish sandal/ slide and then I came across these. I wasn't aware that they were crocs until after I purchased them. Let me just say I am not a fan of the bulky style of crocs. However, when they arrived I simply fell in love with the color and then I tried them on and needless to say I went right back online and ordered another pair in Neptune color. They are sooooooo comfortable and stylish at the same time. The color is bright and vibrant as the photo. I am now a fan of this style of croc.

"416","Crocs Unisex-Adult Baya Ii Slides Sandal","Good quick shoe","KP","These crocs are easy to slip on to run out and do the garbage, take the dog out, etc. Sizing is odd, and can't really advise on that. My foot is a 9.5/10 wide and my son is an 11. This shoe fits us both the same. They are a bit slippery if they get wet, both the grip of the shoe and the footbed. So I have to be careful if it is raining out. But I do have a huge positive. We have a young puppy who is chewing everything. Shoes are his favorite. He got my slip on Vans and ruined them in a very short period of time. However, he has gotten these a couple times, and there is barely any evidence he has chewed on them except for a couple of tooth piercings. So they are very durable, most definitely. We purchased a second pair shortly after this one. Would recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"435","Crocs Unisex-Adult Baya Ii Slides Sandal","For a cool dad like me.","knocks","It’s so crazy that Crocs have come back into style . I used to wear crocs over 15 years ago but everyone thought it was dorky. Ive always loved slides, this athletic footwear shape with the one band across. For the last several years I’ve been wearing the standard slides from adidas, UA, etc. I picked this Crocs up on sale because it is very comfortable and rubber is softer. Doesn’t seem to smell like other slides. Plus, can put those cool jibbetz to customize. Pick this up if you want to show those teens who the real cool croc wearers are.","Reviewed in the United States on 31 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"437","Crocs Unisex-Adult Baya Ii Slides Sandal","Different~not the same","Dede Smith","I have been buying this slip on Baya to use as house shoes, etc.  This one is totally different than the 3 that are in my closet.  Smaller & tighter.  Shorter in length.  I counted the amount of holes going across the band..less meaning its shorter and tighter.  Matched up with my Crocs sole to sole...shorter. So, either Crocs cut down on the shoe and materials (like ice cream containers smaller & smaller) or something else is amiss but my size that I have been buying for years and years is no longer my size and now so narrow.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Initially, the tiny massagers may be uncomfortable but just give it some time and you'll eventually never want to take them off. I use them as my in-the house sandals and one of my favorite moments everyday is getting off work and putting these sandals on.The other main reason I love these sandals is that your feet do not sweat in them. I do not have naturally sweaty feet but for some reason in other sandals my feet would sweat and within a week the sandals would smell awful.

So I mean for $55 these were a steal. Plus I light the highlight green. Gotten so many compliments, some people have told me they resemble Balenciagas shape wise. So all around good show for walking or casual purposes.Cons: Not in every case, but if you have large, wide feet like me, your foot and toes will be visibly pronounced as you can see in the photos.

Damit Sie noch welche zum abwechseln hat, musste noch ein zweites Paar her, und wir haben uns für diese entschieden. Da sie ja bereits welche hat, die ihr auch super passen, haben wir natürlich die gleiche Größe bestellt. Bereits nach dem Auspacken, ist uns aber direkt aufgefallen, dass diese hier kleiner und schmaler wirken. Beim Anprobieren hat sich das dann leider auch bestätigt. Ich wusste ja, dass Größen (gerade bei Adidas) unterschiedlich ausfallen können. Das es jedoch sogar beim ""selben"" Schuh bzw. bei der selben Serie solche Unterschiede gibt, hätte ich nicht gedacht, aber sie fallen echt völlig anders aus.

Yo calzo en 45 en zapatillas Nike para running, he pedido un 46 de estas chanclas y me van perfectas.- No sé si son falsas o no, pero desde luego que si son una falsificación, están muy bien hechas. El tacto es igual al material de cualquier chancla adidas que puedas ver en cualquier tienda oficial y son muy ergonómicas y cómodas. El hecho de que vengan en bolsa y no en caja, no significa que sean falsas. Yo he comprado chanclas originales Nike y algunas vienen en bolsa.- El color este blanco y dorado es mucho más bonito cuando las tienes puestas que en las fotos.- También he leído que son iguales que las que valen 5€ en la playa... A mí me gustaría saber en qué playas venden chanclas de estas se pala a 5€, porque con ese dinero no te compras ya ni una botella de agua.- En resumen...

In summary, I wear a size 8 and I ordered ""A Size 8"" and these fit PERFECTLY. They are made to fit wide, though! I have yet to actually wear them as our weather here in MI is just getting to that point. I hope that they don't rub/hurt my feet when  I wear them.

Compré este tipo de zapatillas también de otras dos conocidas marcas, y una de ellas la tuve que devolver porque era extremadamente dura, muy incomoda, la otra me la quedé porque era aceptable su comodidad. Pero estas de Adidas han resultado ser las más cómodas con diferencia, además tras ponérmelas me da la sensación de que también absorben el sudor de la planta del pie, como si el material además de ser bastante blando, fuera algo poroso, a diferencia de otras que son tan impermeables que acumulan el sudor y la sensación no termina siendo buena. Por ahora muy contento con el producto, veremos a medio y largo plazo si no se suelta la cinta que sujeta el pie, es la única parte susceptible de fallar con el tiempo, si el producto no es de calidad, viniendo de Adidas confío en que será de calidad y no tendré problemas.","Reviewed in Spain on 16 May 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"898","adidas Originals Adilette Slip-On Slides","Comfortable but Develop an Odor","oriano","These Adidas slides are not designed to get wet. They are not waterproof nor water-resistant. So definitely do not use these when getting out of the shower or around the pool.Also, these seem to develop and hold onto a foot odor over time. I take care of my feet, they are relatively clean, and I shower daily (including briefly cleaning my feet). Still, these developed a foot odor over time, even while I had only been wearing these indoors within my house.If you are looking for waterproof slides that can be used inside/outside the shower or around the pool, I instead suggest purchasing Adilette Shower Slides or Adilette Aqua Slides, both from Adidas. These are actually waterproof--the water will not soak into any of the materials.And if you are looking for comfortable slides--the ones that feel like you are walking on clouds--I suggest purchasing Adilette Comfort Slides from Adidas. These are not as waterproof as the Shower or Aqua slides, but they still seem water-resistant. More importantly, the footbed is actually very soft and comfortable.

"914","adidas","Not like the older versions, cut my foot!","Erica R.","I have been wearing these adidas sandals for 30 years. Over this time I've had I think 4 pairs, and usually the only reason I buy new ones is because they've been ruined by a dog or something like that. I bought these ones a while back and they were so uncomfortable and different than previous ones that I couldn't bring myself to break them in, so I fixed up my old pair and have been wearing them. I decided to finally give them another shot. I wore them around the house for a few hours and they cut the tops of my toes! All of them! I'm not talking blisters, I'm talking bleeding cuts on my skin. The underside of the sandal that goes over the foot is not at all soft like my old pairs (the material is not the same, it's thinner and more plastic-y) and the foot bed is hard also (not the cushiony foam). I feel like these are counterfeit but they were sold by Amazon so I doubt they would sell fake adidas apparel. I would definitely not recommend these sandals, sorry to say but these are not like the ones I've known, loved, and trusted over the years. I was expecting to have to break them in a little bit, but these I can't bear to wear at all.

"916","adidas","Do Not Buy for Big Feet","Cory A","I have size 15 men's feet. I have noticed a trend with large-sized slides and thong sandals. Sandal makers do not know how the foot scales up. By that I mean, my feet are a couple inches longer than the average male's, but my ankles, while larger, are not also a full two inches longer. So Adidas puts the strap (around) 3/4 the way up the shoe, and when the average size 10 man slides his foot in, it stops so his toes sit comfortably. The size 15 slide also puts the strap 3/4 up the shoe. However, I have more foot to slide in before it reaches my ankle. So when my foot comes to a stop in these slides, my toes hang way over. The fix to this would be not to treat larger shoe sizes as carbon copies of the average model, and to place the strap further down the shoe.Two stars because it's a good looking slide and Adidas is not the only shoemaker who makes this mistake.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 August 2019","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Es tat sooooo gut.Sie sollten Hausschuhe für mich sein.Nach ein paar Tagen, wurden die Schuhe bei dauerhaftem in der Wohnung an haben aber etwas unangenehm, als wären meine Füße aufgeraut.Nach etwa zwei Wochen habe ich den Unterschied zu anderen Adiletten praktisch nicht mehr wahrgenommen.Als Hausschuh sind sie also nicht wirklich empfehlenswert, zumal sich natürlich auch gerne schmutz zwischen den Massageknubbeln anhäuft. Ich nutze sie jetzt nur noch zum Duschen oder in der Therme (wofür Badelatschen ja auch Eigene gedacht sind)Es sei dazu gesagt, dass ich eine ziemlich dicke Hornhaut am Fuß habe. Ich gehe davon aus, dass Leute mit weicheren Füßen schneller ein unangenehmes empfinden verspüren und nach einem Tag im Schwimmbad mit dann noch nassen Füßen eher unentspannt nach Hause gehen.Passen tun sie perfekt.

"992","adidas Unisex-Adult Adissage Sandal","Great fit and adjustable","AC BC DC","I like to wear flip flops at home. Then I like to wear socks in the winter as well. This becomes a problem with regular flip flops that have the toe separators and thy are very uncomfortable.These slides are the best. I wear shoes ranging from 12-14 depending on the style. These are size 14 and they fit just right - even with socks. I bought these because there is some adjustability for wide feet given the flaps in front are adjustable. I had bought fixed (non-adjustable) nike slides in size 13 and my feet wouldn't even enter the slides. So these slides are great for me.I had an adidas pair of slides in a different color combo before - the same kind as these with the accupressure nubs. The nubs wore off after a year and then couldn't find the same kind for a long time. So glad I found these on Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It takes a while to break them in, or rather to break your feet in so that the nubs massage instead of hurting. But once your tender feet get used to them, it's smooth sailing. I've had them for 6 months, and they still look like new. I've had the black adidas slides before, and I would lose/break nubs from the area under the ball of my foot after a few months.

Siguiendo con la parte del empeine por las reseñas he acabado pensando que son susceptibles de romperse puesto que va pegado a la base de la chancla (no cosido), también la parte interna de éste empeine tiene una tela con porosidad y no es como para ir mojándolas, si no tiene pinta de que van a durar poco.Dicho ésto, estoy muy contento con ellas pero dejándolas para un uso de estar por casa o ir a dar una vuelta y poder ir con los pies al aire.","Reviewed in Spain on 21 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Shockingly, I received the black version of the same shoe from Amazon, and the sole of both the left and right shoes completely tore apart within just 2 months, as evident in the attached photos. It's deeply disappointing and frustrating to see Amazon or Nike playing with our hard-earned money like it's a joke. I demand that Amazon or Nike take immediate action to rectify this situation. If my concerns are not addressed promptly, I won't hesitate to share my terrible experience on YouTube, exposing the lack of quality and customer careUPDATE AFTER 2 MONTHS:- There is NO HELP from Nike or AmazonI pwrsonally suggest nike revolution 6 is not good especially if you wanna wear in all seasons including  mansoonI am using such nike from 2014Amazon I very much disliked your service.An Executive  named Afreen said me on call ""if nike dosent helps you,then Amazon will give you all refund""But later on call they said you have exceeded your timing of 10 days you are not gonna get any help from us, I also have proofs.I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY AS WELL","Reviewed in India on 10 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Las sandalias estan muy bonitas, son antiderrapantes, buena superficie para la planta del pie - PERO - al no estar acolchado en el interior (lo que da al empeine)… la horma es muy grande para un pie ancho (mi pie es delgado), así que me queda muy flojo!Si van a comprar este tipo de sandalias, les recomiendo una medida abajo a la suya (yo debí comprar talla 29, en vez de 30).

Unless you need the security like walking near wet areas, then go for your size, but if you just want a slip on and slip off, go one size up. Size aside, it is very secure and great material. PS. I did buy a size up and gave the smaller size to my siblings.","Reviewed in Canada on 15 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1513","Under Armour Men's Locker Camo Slide Sandal","Sizes Run SMALL, get a size up","Mark","Recently purchased these as my red Nike slides popped. I already trust the under Armour brand, so I knew what to expect before I got them.BEWARE: buy a size up. I’ve attached some images here, the Red Nike Slide is a 12. The under armor slide is ALSO a 12, yet my foot doesn’t even FIT in the 12 from UA. I ended up having to get a 13 which fit me better.If you’re reading this review, they are worth the money. Just make sure you BUY A SIZE UP, if you’re a 12 like me get a 13. Their sizes run small.Slip on, can easily rinse them off, they’re a good pair of slides OVERALL. You can wear them in the house, or outside. Throw some water on them and they’re new again.

"1580","Under Armour Men's Tech Short Sleeve T-Shirt","I like these a lot","Atlanta User","I buy these on sale and have been lucky so far.  They are far more durable and fit better than ""always cheap"" synthetic tees.  The stitching survives a lot of use - no loose or hanging threads so far.  They are not super breathable and not super heavy.  I wear large size in summer for air flow but medium most of the year.  They dry fast and I can easily just hang them up overnight to dry vs a dryer (this makes shirts last a LOT longer if you do that).I have a hard time paying full price for anything. They would probably be worth it at full price but sales happen and these are good, durable tees.

I was excited to try this version at this price point. I'll tell you that I'll wear them working out - lifting, group exercises classes, CrossFit, that sort of thing. I'm also training for a marathon though and I wore them on two separate occasions for longer runs - 8 miles and 12 miles. The material these are made from are a little more rough over my other pairs of UA compression shorts. Yes they compress fine, but on longer runs they started chafing me. The first time I thought maybe it was a fluke so I gave them another shot with the same results you can feel during your shower after when hot soapy water goes to the rubbed and worn skin.In the end, I'll wear them to the gym for a workout - I'm hesitant for all day at the beach, but def a no-go for distance running.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

 First time buying compression shorts for my son.All those Amazon 3-in-a-pack deals dont work. They are just underwear made to look like compression shorts. We bought different brands to try but none worked.This one is way better quality - spandex is strong, material is thicker. You can tell it’s made for its purpose. Waist band is a lot thicker than usual underwear as well.The video and picture is for XS. We kept the S size. He is 16, 5’7”, 125lbs and wears S size in pants.In comparison, the 3-packs S sizes are loose and even one of them did fit (no excess fabric), it just felt he’s wearing a long pair of underwear. We were tempted to keep that S size that fitted ($26 for 3 pairs) but glad underarmour came in the mail just in time.It should be snug and feels like tighter than wearing a scuba diving suit. You can feel it’s compression all around including the thighs.I wish the S size was on sale (XS grey in this video was $15) so we end up paying $22 for the S black color underarmour. Cost almost 3x more than the 3-packs but better one that works than 3 that does not perform.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Así que unos Nike se me acaban en un año al punto de tirarse hechos polvo... quise probar esta marca por dos temas: la comodida, confirmo que son comodos más no andas en una nubecita como algunos nike pero si vamos a puntuar la comodidad diría que un 8.5 cuando unos vans o unos converse son 1. La suela si pisas mojado no tiene mucho agarre, no es que te resbales pero el agarre en piso mojado y liso es como de 4-5 para que tengan cuidado en ese tema. Creo que en relación costo beneficio son unos excelentes tenis. Creo que comprare más de la marca buscando precios más altos esperando tengan un mejor confort.

"1908","Under Armour Men's UA Surge 3","I love these","José J.","These shoes are versatile- good for walking or running or other kinds of sport, they’re comfortable and quite lightweight, I run in these but I’d say there are better running shoes. I’ve had in the past. Although I’d buy another pair in a different colour. Maybe the black and white or grey. They fit me well and the white colour I got looks nice. Better than any of the photos advertised really. They do stain easily but as long as you clean them straight away when you get home it’s alright. They’re quite bendy and give a sort of boost when you jump in them which is nice. Good shoes","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

For the first couple weeks they were hard on my heels. Nothing a couple bandaids or k tape couldn’t fix! Now that they are broken in, they are a dream. They keep your feet nice and cool for hot runs or hot summer days when you’re out walking. I think once mine bite the dust, I will definitely order again! I gave 4 stars because of the rough beginning and because the sizing is a bit off. After reading other reviews and checking out the size chart on the website, I decided to order half size up and I’m glad I did.

They feel like an extension of my feet, allowing me to focus on my stride and pace without feeling weighed down. The breathability of the materials is also a standout feature, keeping my feet cool and dry even during intense workouts.Overall, I highly recommend these running trainers to anyone who is serious about their fitness goals.

They don’t even feel like you’re wearing shoes. The wife likes the look and feel so much she made me order her a woman’s pair of the same shoe.

"1976","Under Armour","great shoes but sizing has changed over the years","Jessy","I bought a pair of these runners at a bricks & mortar store in size 11.5 a year or two ago and they have been great; comfortable and durable. They are still usable but starting to go so I thought I would order new ones when they were on sale for under 50$ in October 2023. Good deal. Unfortunately, despite receiving size 11.5 again, these shoes were smaller this time. It wasn't just that the old ones had stretched from use, of course they did.  But my toes were crushed into the end of these new shoes, quite uncomfortably so, and there is no way they would fit with wear. The same size was simply smaller now. They felt like a size 11. Perhaps over the years there has been a change in factory or out-sourcing the shoe manufacturing etc...

"1978","Under Armour","Incredibilmente confortevoli e resistenti","Jabelone","Ho recentemente acquistato le scarpe da corsa Under Armour Uomo UA Charged Assert 9 e devo dire che sono decisamente impressionato per il prezzo pagato.Queste scarpe combinano comfort, durata e stile in un unico, fantastico pacchetto.Il primo aspetto che colpisce è il design. Non solo sembrano ottime, ma sono anche costruite per durare. Le utilizzo sia in palestra che per correre su strada e la suola in gomma di alta qualità fornisce un'eccellente trazione su diversi tipi di terreno, e l'intersuola Charged Cushioning assorbe gli impatti, rendendo ogni corsa o camminata un'esperienza molto confortevole.Buona la vestibilità. Il sistema di allacciatura personalizzabile consente di ottenere la perfetta aderenza, garantendo al contempo flessibilità. Queste scarpe si adattano perfettamente al piede, minimizzando il rischio di sfregamenti o punti di pressione.Ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità, raccomando queste scarpe per chi vuole una scarpa da running non da professionisti ma comunque con buone prestazioni.","Reviewed in Canada on 19 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2056","THE NORTH FACE Unisex Vault Rucksack","Heavy backpack but decent for school","Stormy","I'm a bit biased when it comes to North Face products because I've been using their brand for many years. So, last year I decided to get the North Face Vault backpack for my son in middle school. He liked that it was black and that it had sturdy straps. I'm going to point out the pros and cons:Pros: very sturdy and can put 1 Chromebook (has it's own pocket for laptops/chromebooks), 3 books, and about 3-5 folders/notebooks. Yes, that's a lot for a middle school, but we tested the backpack out putting in as much stuff as possible when we first got it. There are 2 front pockets. One is larger than the other. My son put his pens/pencils, etc. in the smaller pocket. The bigger pocket had his earbud case, calculator, and other small items for his classes. There are 2 side pockets for water bottles. The zippers are easy to grasp all around with 2 separate zipper pulls. The straps are thick and there is a strap you can tie around your waist area for more security and support.Cons: the mesh-style water bottle holders aren't very well sewn. One of them broke after a month. Granted, you are going to constantly take out and put back your water bottles so I thought the holders should have held up for at least one school year, right? The backpack itself is pretty heavy with nothing in it. So, be prepared to carry a very heavy backpack if your child's school doesn't have lockers for them to put their stuff in and they have to carry their books and laptops all day.Overall, this backpack held up well enough for about one year and a half. I did notice some of the seams on the front pockets become looser but that could just be a user issue. The ripped water bottle holders on the side being ripped so easily could have been made with higher quality material or stitching.I think it's a nice looking backpack.  It's not flashy and it has a small North Face logo.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2084","THE NORTH FACE Unisex Vault Rucksack","Do not like the accessory pocket / second zippered compartment; bag does not stand up","D Weber","This backpack is very sturdy, but not particularly functional.  the main compartment is very good, although the laptop padded sleeve is very tight (ie, best for a 13 inch laptop, tight for a 15, and impossible for a 17).  I have two main complaints, both of which require the return of this product.  First, the second compartment is not full length, and runs only halfway down the pack.  As such, all your accessories (pens, cords, keys, clif bar, etc.) are in the second compartment, and this runs only halfway down.  When you open the zipper to get at stuff, because it is all top-weight (because it does not go all the way down), the second compartment flops down as soon as the zipper is opened.  It is annoying as hell, and makes getting stuff out difficult.  Competitor bags, including the bag this replaced, the Under Armour Hustle, have the compartment go all the way down.  This prevents the flop when you open the zipper.  Second major complaint, but similar, is that the bag will not stand on its own.  So when you bring it to your desk or next to your desk, it will not stand up.  It always wants to fall over.  Competitor bags do not do this.  Because I am using this bag as my mobile professional office, these two items alone make it impossible to use the bag.  This is disappointing, because other features are better than competitors.  Some items that are better:  material construction is better; fabric is more durable; and most importantly, the straps are more comfortable.  But in the end, the functionality is impaired by the second pocket and the failure to be self-standing.  I am returning the item.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2106","THE NORTH FACE Unisex's Jester Shoulder Bag, One Size, Tnf Black","Nice, but...","my2cents","I wanted a small, rugged bag that could carry a water bottle, phone, snack, and small first aid kit for hikes. I didn't want something worn across the back. Since the lashing appeared to hold a water bottle (and a few reviews mentioned using the lashing for that purpose), I thought this would be the perfect hiking companion. Yes, a water bottle is taller, but yes, a water bottle does fit in the front lashing. The problem is that makes the slip pocket behind the lashing inaccessible. More problematic though, is that it limits how much stuff can fit in the main compartment of the bag. One would pretty much need to remove the water bottle from the front lashing in order to get into the main part of the bag. The bag itself is well made, just not suited for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Tthe cord will probably let you hang it around your waist but it’s not super usable that way if you hang it off your neck it can go as low as your hip or you can tighten it where it comes up to your chest right in the middle pretty much hope that’s usable it makes for an OK chest pack by the way but if you’re running it’ll flap up and down if there’s anyway you can secure it that would be cool","Reviewed in the United States on 9 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They are so basic and feel like something that could be from Walmart for $5, rather than a high-quality brand. They were stiff and uncomfortable when I first bought them, but a few wears later they did form a bit better to my foot. The fabric/mess lining on the pink pair looks grayish in real life, rather than matching pink, which makes them look dirty. They do seem like they will last for a while, so if I can tolerate them I will wear them until they wear out, but definitely wouldn't buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I was comparing this shoe vs the uggs Tasman tsl and I did like the structure of the uggs more but because of the price point I wanted to try these out. I did not expect it go be so soft and keep warm as if there thermal technology. I thought crocs were the most comfortable slip on shoes till I wore these. The only downside which isn’t too much of a problem for me is that the back u can’t just slide into since it’s flimsy so u have to use your finger to slip it on your heel I don’t mind it but comparing it to the Uggs it would be more convenient if the back was more structured. Other than that I’ve been loving the shoes enough to write a review which I normally don’t do I will be for sure purchasing a pair for my grandma :) also another thing I forgot to point out is I am a fan of white shoes but I can never keep them clean but so far since the material is I believe nylon?

But then I tried them on. The ankle opening was way too tight. I could get them on easily enough, but they remained tight enough to be uncomfortable even after on. You can wear them as a mule, but I don’t want that to be the only comfortable option. Also, while I didn’t expect much in the way of arch support, etc., these had nothing. Knees, etc caved inward immediately- seemingly more than if I was barefoot and to the point I’d be preoccupied about it causing irritation over time. The sole was thinner than anticipated; you’d feel anything/everything you stepped on. They’re cute, and I wish they’d worked out, but there were too many design flaws to justify keeping them.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These gloves fit ""like a glove""  - they are the perfect length for my small hands, and the touch screen fingers work better than any other glove I've tried.  HOWEVER, and this is a big deal, the opening for the wrist is so small and has zero stretch, so I can barely get them on at all.  I have to wiggle them over the widest part of my hand and can barely get them on. Once on they are great, so I'm keeping them for now, but I don't know how long I'll be able to deal with that difficulty of getting them on/off.

"2350","THE NORTH FACE Jester Backpack","Obnoxiously top-heavy","Kristen Ratner","This is a well-constructed backpack that feels high quality. The padding on the back is great, it's breathable, and very comfortable to wear. I liked so much about it, but the top-heaviness made it a total deal breaker. There is one large compartment with a laptop/tablet pocket that's very useful. However, the smaller outer zip pocket only goes halfway down the bag. Which means that if you put too much in it, the bag tips over no matter how you try to lean it against anything. It also makes it difficult to access the large compartment. Also, if the zipper on the large compartment is even slightly open when you have a lot of things in the smaller pocket, the weight of the small pocket opens up the large compartment, resulting in your things spilling all over the place. Additionally, despite having a pocket on either side for water bottles, you can only carry one at a time because the pocket on the other side becomes very small when using one pocket. I'd been using this backpack for a few months for school, so I can't return, but believe me when I say the problems I mentioned here have been a daily irritation, which made me really regret buying it.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 November 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
