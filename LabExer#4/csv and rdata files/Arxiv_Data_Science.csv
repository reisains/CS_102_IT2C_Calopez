Here we present the NIRSpec Wide survey, part of the NIRSpec Instrument Science Team's Guaranteed Time Observations, using NIRSpec's microshutter array to obtain spectra of more than 3200 galaxies at $z>1$ at both low- and high-resolution ($R\approx100$ and 2700) for a total of 105 hours. With 31 pointings covering $\approx$320 arcmin$^2$ across the five CANDELS fields with exquisite ancillary photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, the NIRSpec Wide survey represents a fast and efficient way of using JWST to probe galaxies in the early Universe. Pointing centers are determined to maximize the observability of the rarest, high-value sources. Subsequently, the microshutter configurations are optimized to observe the maximum number of ""census"" galaxies with a selection function based primarily on HST/F160W magnitude, photometric/slitless grism redshift, and predicted \ha\ flux tracing the bulk of the galaxy population at cosmic noon ($z_{\rm med}=2.0$). We present details on the survey strategy, the target selection, an outline of the motivating science cases, and discuss upcoming public data releases to the community.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 18:26:38 UTC (3,200 KB)"
"2","Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a Lyapunov equation","Ian Xul Belaustegui, Marcela Ordorica Arango, Rom√°n Rossi Pool, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Alessio Franci","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 17:07:37 UTC (2,163 KB)"

However, in 2023, skepticism surfaced within industrial and academic spheres, raising concerns that excitement may outpace actual technological progress. Interoperability, recognized as a major barrier to the Metaverse's full potential, is central to this debate. CoinMarketCap's report in February 2023 indicated that of over 240 metaverse initiatives, most existed in isolation, underscoring the interoperability challenge. Despite consensus on its critical role, there is a research gap in exploring the impact on the Metaverse, significance, and developmental extent. Our study bridges this gap via a systematic literature review and content analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, yielding 74 publications after a rigorous selection process. Interoperability, difficult to define due to varied contexts and lack of standardization, is central to the Metaverse, often seen as a digital ecosystem. Urs Gasser's framework from Harvard Law School, outlining technological, data, human, and institutional dimensions, systematically addresses interoperability complexities. Incorporating this framework, we dissect literature for a comprehensive Metaverse interoperability overview. Our study seeks to establish benchmarks for future inquiries, navigating the complex field of Metaverse interoperability studies and contributing to academic advancement.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 10:38:01 UTC (7,107 KB)"
"5","Efficient Algorithms for Personalized PageRank Computation: A Survey","Mingji Yang, Hanzhi Wang, Zhewei Wei, Sibo Wang, Ji-Rong Wen","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a traditional measure for node proximity on large graphs. For a pair of nodes $s$ and $t$, the PPR value $\pi_s(t)$ equals the probability that an $\alpha$-discounted random walk from $s$ terminates at $t$ and reflects the importance between $s$ and $t$ in a bidirectional way. As a generalization of Google's celebrated PageRank centrality, PPR has been extensively studied and has found multifaceted applications in many fields, such as network analysis, graph mining, and graph machine learning. Despite numerous studies devoted to PPR over the decades, efficient computation of PPR remains a challenging problem, and there is a dearth of systematic summaries and comparisons of existing algorithms. In this paper, we recap several frequently used techniques for PPR computation and conduct a comprehensive survey of various recent PPR algorithms from an algorithmic perspective. We classify these approaches based on the types of queries they address and review their methodologies and contributions. We also discuss some representative algorithms for computing PPR on dynamic graphs and in parallel or distributed environments.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 10:19:34 UTC (12,011 KB)"

We present a privacy-respectful approach - context-enriched keyboard logging - that allows for the extraction of contextual information on the user's input motive, which is meaningful for linguistics, psychology, and behavioral sciences. In particular, with our approach, we enable distinguishing language contents by their channel (i.e., comments, messaging, search inputs). Filtering by channel allows for better pre-selection of data, which is in the interest of researchers and improves users' privacy. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale six-month user study (N=624) of language use in smartphone interactions in the wild. Finally, we highlight the implications for research on language use in human-computer interaction and interdisciplinary contexts.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 09:41:01 UTC (3,282 KB)"

Advanced AI technologies, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have emerged as a powerful tool to augment and accelerate this inverse design process. By modeling the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequential decision-making problem, RL approaches can construct a satisfactory PCSEL structure from scratch. However, the data inefficiency resulting from online interactions with precise and expensive simulation environments impedes the broader applicability of RL approaches. Recently, sequential models, especially the Transformer architecture, have exhibited compelling performance in sequential decision-making problems due to their simplicity and scalability to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named PCSEL Inverse Design Transformer (PiT) that abstracts the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequence modeling problem. The central part of our PiT is a Transformer-based structure that leverages the past trajectories and current states to predict the current actions. Compared with the traditional RL approaches, PiT can output the optimal actions and achieve target PCSEL designs by leveraging offline data and conditioning on the desired return. Results demonstrate that PiT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 08:38:50 UTC (2,445 KB)"

Hunt, Sabine Reffert","Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)","The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.

"9","Single Family Algebra Operation on ZDDs Leads To Exponential Blow-Up","Kengo Nakamura, Masaaki Nishino, Shuhei Denzumi","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) is a data structure to represent a family of (sub)sets compactly, and it can be used as a succinct index for a family of sets. To build ZDD representing a desired family of sets, there are many transformation operations that take ZDDs as inputs and output ZDD representing the resultant family after performing operations such as set union and intersection. However, except for some basic operations, the worst-time complexity of taking such transformation on ZDDs has not been extensively studied, and some contradictory statements about it have arisen in the literature. In this paper, we show that many transformation operations on ZDDs cannot be performed in worst-case polynomial time with respect to the size of input ZDDs. This refutes some of the folklore circulated in past literature and resolves an open problem raised by Knuth. Our results are stronger in that such blow-up of computational time occurs even when the ordering, which has a significant impact on the efficiency of treating ZDDs, is reasonable.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 05:57:12 UTC (371 KB)"
"10","Data-Dependent LSH for the Earth Mover's Distance","Rajesh Jayaram, Erik Waingarten, Tian Zhang","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We give new data-dependent locality sensitive hashing schemes (LSH) for the Earth Mover's Distance ($\mathsf{EMD}$), and as a result, improve the best approximation for nearest neighbor search under $\mathsf{EMD}$ by a quadratic factor. Here, the metric $\mathsf{EMD}_s(\mathbb{R}^d,\ell_p)$ consists of sets of $s$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and for any two sets $x,y$ of $s$ vectors the distance $\mathsf{EMD}(x,y)$ is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $x,y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance. Previously, Andoni, Indyk, and Krauthgamer gave a (data-independent) locality-sensitive hashing scheme for $\mathsf{EMD}_s(\mathbb{R}^d,\ell_p)$ when $p \in [1,2]$ with approximation $O(\log^2 s)$. By being data-dependent, we improve the approximation to $\tilde{O}(\log s)$. Our main technical contribution is to show that for any distribution $\mu$ supported on the metric $\mathsf{EMD}_s(\mathbb{R}^d, \ell_p)$, there exists a data-dependent LSH for dense regions of $\mu$ which achieves approximation $\tilde{O}(\log s)$, and that the data-independent LSH actually achieves a $\tilde{O}(\log s)$-approximation outside of those dense regions. Finally, we show how to ""glue"" together these two hashing schemes without any additional loss in the approximation. Beyond nearest neighbor search, our data-dependent LSH also gives optimal (distributional) sketches for the Earth Mover's Distance. By known sketching lower bounds, this implies that our LSH is optimal (up to $\mathrm{poly}(\log \log s)$ factors) among those that collide close points with constant probability.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 04:35:55 UTC (136 KB)"

It is written so as to not require any prior knowledge of the related literature, and in particular does not use Yao's method.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 02:27:59 UTC (6 KB)"
"12","NP-Completeness for the Space-Optimality of Double-Array Tries","Hideo Bannai, Keisuke Goto, Shunsuke Kanda, Dominik K√∂ppl","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Indexing a set of strings for prefix search or membership queries is a fundamental task with many applications such as information retrieval or database systems. A classic abstract data type for modelling such an index is a trie. Due to the fundamental nature of this problem, it has sparked much interest, leading to a variety of trie implementations with different characteristics. A trie implementation that has been well-used in practice is the double-array (trie) consisting of merely two integer arrays. While a traversal takes constant time per node visit, the needed space consumption in computer words can be as large as the product of the number of nodes and the alphabet size. Despite that several heuristics have been proposed on lowering the space requirements, we are unaware of any theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study the decision problem whether there exists a double-array of a given size. To this end, we first draw a connection to the sparse matrix compression problem, which makes our problem NP-complete for alphabet sizes linear to the number of nodes. We further propose a reduction from the restricted directed Hamiltonian path problem, leading to NP-completeness even for logarithmic-sized alphabets.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 23:41:01 UTC (787 KB)"
"13","A Mixed-Integer Conic Program for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem based on a Graph of Convex Sets","Allen George Philip, Zhongqiang Ren, Sivakumar Rathinam, Howie Choset","Robotics (cs.RO)","This paper introduces a new formulation that finds the optimum for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP), which seeks to find a shortest path for an agent, that starts at a depot, visits a set of moving targets exactly once within their assigned time-windows, and returns to the depot. The formulation relies on the key idea that when the targets move along lines, their trajectories become convex sets within the space-time coordinate system. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path within a graph of convex sets, subject to some speed constraints. We compare our formulation with the current state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Conic Program (MICP) solver for the MT-TSP. The experimental results show that our formulation outperforms the MICP for instances with up to 20 targets, with up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and up to a 60\% tighter optimality gap. We also show that the solution cost from the convex relaxation of our formulation provides significantly tighter lower bounds for the MT-TSP than the ones from the MICP.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 22:03:36 UTC (963 KB)"
"14","Towards Robust Data-Driven Automated Recovery of Symbolic Conservation Laws from Limited Data","Tracey Oellerich, Maria Emelianenko","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","Conservation laws are an inherent feature in many systems modeling real world phenomena, in particular, those modeling biological and chemical systems. If the form of the underlying dynamical system is known, linear algebra and algebraic geometry methods can be used to identify the conservation laws. Our work focuses on using data-driven methods to identify the conservation law(s) in the absence of the knowledge of system dynamics. Building in part upon the ideas proposed in [arXiv:1811.00961], we develop a robust data-driven computational framework that automates the process of identifying the number and type of the conservation law(s) while keeping the amount of required data to a minimum. We demonstrate that due to relative stability of singular vectors to noise we are able to reconstruct correct conservation laws without the need for excessive parameter tuning. While we focus primarily on biological examples, the framework proposed herein is suitable for a variety of data science applications and can be coupled with other machine learning approaches.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 20:48:18 UTC (1,551 KB)"

In this short note, we give a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\min\left\{\log n, \sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}}\right\}\right)$ on the expected approximation ratio of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm, which is the first evidence that the approximation ratio has to grow with the size of the metric space.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:47:20 UTC (10 KB)"
"16","Corrective or Backfire: Characterizing and Predicting User Response to Social Correction","Bing He, Yingchen Ma, Mustaque Ahamad, Srijan Kumar","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Online misinformation poses a global risk with harmful implications for society. Ordinary social media users are known to actively reply to misinformation posts with counter-misinformation messages, which is shown to be effective in containing the spread of misinformation. Such a practice is defined as ""social correction"". Nevertheless, it remains unknown how users respond to social correction in real-world scenarios, especially, will it have a corrective or backfire effect on users. Investigating this research question is pivotal for developing and refining strategies that maximize the efficacy of social correction initiatives. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to characterize and predict the user response to social correction in a data-driven manner through the lens of X (Formerly Twitter), where the user response is instantiated as the reply that is written toward a counter-misinformation message. Particularly, we first create a novel dataset with 55, 549 triples of misinformation tweets, counter-misinformation replies, and responses to counter-misinformation replies, and then curate a taxonomy to illustrate different kinds of user responses. Next, fine-grained statistical analysis of reply linguistic and engagement features as well as repliers' user attributes is conducted to illustrate the characteristics that are significant in determining whether a reply will have a corrective or backfire effect. Finally, we build a user response prediction model to identify whether a social correction will be corrective, neutral, or have a backfire effect, which achieves a promising F1 score of 0.816. Our work enables stakeholders to monitor and predict user responses effectively, thus guiding the use of social correction to maximize their corrective impact and minimize backfire effects.

To this end, we present a novel formulation of the Collatz conjecture as a concurrent program, and provide the general case specification of the $j$-th convergence stair for any $j > 0$. The proposed specifications provide a layered and linearized orientation of Collatz numbers organized in an infinite set of infinite binary trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a general specification is provided, which can have significant applications in analyzing and testing the behaviors of complex non-linear systems. We have implemented this method as a software tool that generates the Collatz numbers of individual stairs. We also show that starting from any value in any convergence stair the conjecture holds. However, to prove the conjecture, one has to show that every natural number will appear in some stair; i.e., the union of all stairs is equal to the set of natural numbers, which remains an open problem.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 17:36:54 UTC (949 KB)"
"18","SQ Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis with Weaker Assumptions","Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane, Lisheng Ren, Yuxin Sun","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We study the complexity of Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Prior work developed a general methodology to prove SQ lower bounds for this task that have been applicable to a wide range of contexts. In particular, it was known that for any univariate distribution $A$ satisfying certain conditions, distinguishing between a standard multivariate Gaussian and a distribution that behaves like $A$ in a random hidden direction and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, is SQ-hard. The required conditions were that (1) $A$ matches many low-order moments with the standard univariate Gaussian, and (2) the chi-squared norm of $A$ with respect to the standard Gaussian is finite. While the moment-matching condition is necessary for hardness, the chi-squared condition was only required for technical reasons. In this work, we establish that the latter condition is indeed not necessary. In particular, we prove near-optimal SQ lower bounds for NGCA under the moment-matching condition only. Our result naturally generalizes to the setting of a hidden subspace. Leveraging our general SQ lower bound, we obtain near-optimal SQ lower bounds for a range of concrete estimation tasks where existing techniques provide sub-optimal or even vacuous guarantees.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:49:32 UTC (32 KB)"
"19","A Sub-Quadratic Time Algorithm for Robust Sparse Mean Estimation","Ankit Pensia","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study the algorithmic problem of sparse mean estimation in the presence of adversarial outliers. Specifically, the algorithm observes a \emph{corrupted} set of samples from $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\mathbf{I}_d)$, where the unknown mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is constrained to be $k$-sparse. A series of prior works has developed efficient algorithms for robust sparse mean estimation with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d, 1/\epsilon)$ and runtime $d^2 \mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the fraction of contamination. In particular, the fastest runtime of existing algorithms is quadratic ($\Omega(d^2)$), which can be prohibitive in high dimensions. This quadratic barrier in the runtime stems from the reliance of these algorithms on the sample covariance matrix, which is of size $d^2$. Our main contribution is an algorithm for robust sparse mean estimation which runs in \emph{subquadratic} time using $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$ samples. We also provide analogous results for robust sparse PCA. Our results build on algorithmic advances in detecting weak correlations, a generalized version of the light-bulb problem by Valiant.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:23:51 UTC (46 KB)"

Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:53:37 UTC (8,296 KB)"

Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the classic Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard in split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$ on non-proper interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:43:21 UTC (523 KB)"
"22","Time-Aware Projections: Truly Node-Private Graph Statistics under Continual Observation","Palak Jain, Adam Smith, Connor Wagaman","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We describe the first algorithms that satisfy the standard notion of node-differential privacy in the continual release setting (i.e., without an assumed promise on input streams). Previous work addresses node-private continual release by assuming an unenforced promise on the maximum degree in a graph; indeed, the algorithms from these works exhibit blatant privacy violations when the degree bound is not met. Our algorithms are accurate on sparse graphs, for several fundamental graph problems: counting edges, triangles, other subgraphs, and connected components; and releasing degree histograms. Our unconditionally private algorithms generally have optimal error, up to polylogarithmic factors and lower-order terms. We provide general transformations that take a base algorithm for the continual release setting, which need only be private for streams satisfying a promised degree bound, and produce an algorithm that is unconditionally private yet mimics the base algorithm when the stream meets the degree bound (and adds only linear overhead to the time and space complexity of the base algorithm). To do so, we design new projection algorithms for graph streams, based on the batch-model techniques of Day et al. 2016 and Blocki et al. 2013, which modify the stream to limit its degree. Our main technical innovation is to show that the projections are stable -- meaning that similar input graphs have similar projections -- when the input stream satisfies a privately testable safety condition. Our transformation then follows a novel online variant of the Propose-Test-Release framework (Dwork and Lei, 2009), privately testing the safety condition before releasing output at each step.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 16:14:08 UTC (155 KB)"
"23","Optimizing Inventory Placement for a Downstream Online Matching Problem","Boris Epstein, Will Ma (Columbia University)","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study the inventory placement problem of splitting $Q$ units of a single item across warehouses, in advance of a downstream online matching problem that represents the dynamic fulfillment decisions of an e-commerce retailer. This is a challenging problem both in theory, because the downstream matching problem itself is computationally hard, and in practice, because the fulfillment team is constantly updating its algorithm and the placement team cannot directly evaluate how a placement decision would perform. We compare the performance of three placement procedures based on optimizing surrogate functions that have been studied and applied: Offline, Myopic, and Fluid placement. On the theory side, we show that optimizing inventory placement for the Offline surrogate leads to a $(1-(1-1/d)^d)/2$-approximation for the joint placement and fulfillment problem. We assume $d$ is an upper bound on how many warehouses can serve any demand location and that stochastic arrivals satisfy either temporal or spatial independence. The crux of our theoretical contribution is to use randomized rounding to derive a tight $(1-(1-1/d)^d)$-approximation for the integer programming problem of optimizing the Offline surrogate. We use statistical learning to show that rounding after optimizing a sample-average Offline surrogate, which is necessary due to the exponentially-sized support, does indeed have vanishing loss. On the experimental side, we extract real-world sequences of customer orders from publicly-available this http URL data and evaluate different combinations of placement and fulfillment procedures. Optimizing the Offline surrogate performs best overall, even compared to simulation procedures, corroborating our theory.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 15:46:19 UTC (508 KB)"
"24","Algorithms and complexity for path covers of temporal DAGs: when is Dilworth dynamic?","Dibyayan Chakraborty, Antoine Dailly, Florent Foucaud, Ralf Klasing","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","In this paper, we study a dynamic analogue of the Path Cover problem, which can be solved in polynomial-time in directed acyclic graphs. A temporal digraph has an arc set that changes over discrete time-steps, if the underlying digraph (the union of all the arc sets) is acyclic, then we have a temporal DAG. A temporal path is a directed path in the underlying digraph, such that the time-steps of arcs are strictly increasing along the path. Two temporal paths are temporally disjoint if they do not occupy any vertex at the same time. A temporal (resp. temporally disjoint) path cover is a collection of (resp. temporally disjoint) temporal paths that covers all vertices. In this paper, we study the computational complexities of the problems of finding a temporal (disjoint) path cover with minimum cardinality, denoted as Temporal Path Cover (TPC) and Temporally Disjoint Path Cover (TD-PC). We show that both problems are NP-hard even when the underlying DAG is planar, bipartite, subcubic, and there are only two arc-disjoint time-steps. Moreover, TD-PC remains NP-hard even on temporal oriented trees. In contrast, we show that TPC is polynomial-time solvable on temporal oriented trees by a reduction to Clique Cover for (static undirected) weakly chordal graphs (a subclass of perfect graphs for which Clique Cover admits an efficient algorithm). This highlights an interesting algorithmic difference between the two problems. Although it is NP-hard on temporal oriented trees, TD-PC becomes polynomial-time solvable on temporal oriented lines and temporal rooted directed trees. We also show that TPC (resp. TD-PC) admits an XP (resp. FPT) time algorithm with respect to parameter tmax + tw, where tmax is the maximum time-step, and tw is the treewidth of the underlying static undirected graph.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 15:35:36 UTC (34 KB)"

At the same time, our algorithm is much simpler and more accessible than previous work. In order to obtain our new algorithm, we present a new push-pull-relabel flow framework that generalizes the classic push-relabel flow algorithm of Goldberg-Tarjan (JACM 1988), which was later dynamized for computing expander decompositions in undirected graphs by Henzinger-Rao-Wang (SIAM J.

Motivated by job scheduling, interest in this problem dates back to the work of Deuermeyer et al. [SIAM J. on Algebraic Discrete Methods'82]. Recent works consider the compatibility between resources and assign only mutually compatible resources to an agent. We study a fair allocation problem in which we are given a set of agents, a set of resources, a utility function for every agent over a set of resources, and a {\it conflict graph} on the set of resources (where an edge denotes incompatibility). The goal is to assign resources to the agents such that $(i)$ the set of resources allocated to an agent are compatible with each other, and $(ii)$ the minimum satisfaction of an agent is maximized, where the satisfaction of an agent is the sum of the utility of the assigned resources. Chiarelli et al. [Algorithmica'22] explore this problem from the classical complexity perspective to draw the boundary between the cases that are polynomial-time solvable and those that are \NP-hard.

Meel","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Equivalence testing, a fundamental problem in the field of distribution testing, seeks to infer if two unknown distributions on $[n]$ are the same or far apart in the total variation distance. Conditional sampling has emerged as a powerful query model and has been investigated by theoreticians and practitioners alike, leading to the design of optimal algorithms albeit in a sequential setting (also referred to as adaptive tester). Given the profound impact of parallel computing over the past decades, there has been a strong desire to design algorithms that enable high parallelization. Despite significant algorithmic advancements over the last decade, parallelizable techniques (also termed non-adaptive testers) have $\tilde{O}(\log^{12}n)$ query complexity, a prohibitively large complexity to be of practical usage. Therefore, the primary challenge is whether it is possible to design algorithms that enable high parallelization while achieving efficient query complexity. Our work provides an affirmative answer to the aforementioned challenge: we present a highly parallelizable tester with a query complexity of $\tilde{O}(\log n)$, achieved through a single round of adaptivity, marking a significant stride towards harmonizing parallelizability and efficiency in equivalence testing.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 05:23:06 UTC (30 KB)"

It works effectively in the ideal federation where clients share homogeneous data distribution and learning behavior. However, FL may fail to function appropriately when the federation is not ideal, amid an unhealthy state called Negative Federated Learning (NFL), in which most clients gain no benefit from participating in FL. Many studies have tried to address NFL. However, their solutions either (1) predetermine to prevent NFL in the entire learning life-cycle or (2) tackle NFL in the aftermath of numerous learning rounds. Thus, they either (1) indiscriminately incur extra costs even if FL can perform well without such costs or (2) waste numerous learning rounds. Additionally, none of the previous work takes into account the clients who may be unwilling/unable to follow the proposed NFL solutions when using those solutions to upgrade an FL system in use. This paper introduces FL-GUARD, a holistic framework that can be employed on any FL system for tackling NFL in a run-time paradigm. That is, to dynamically detect NFL at the early stage (tens of rounds) of learning and then to activate recovery measures when necessary. Specifically, we devise a cost-effective NFL detection mechanism, which relies on an estimation of performance gain on clients. Only when NFL is detected, we activate the NFL recovery process, in which each client learns in parallel an adapted model when training the global model. Extensive experiment results confirm the effectiveness of FL-GUARD in detecting NFL and recovering from NFL to a healthy learning state. We also show that FL-GUARD is compatible with previous NFL solutions and robust against clients unwilling/unable to take any recovery measures.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 01:52:05 UTC (2,187 KB)"

Although ML is undeniably useful for identifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in biological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods of scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and scientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for the future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little attention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize recent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical theories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the design and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance scientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency relation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated understanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key application areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have thus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target phenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key obstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool for biological discovery. Consideration of the epistemological features of ML applications in biology will improve the prospects of these methods to solve important problems and advance scientific understanding of living systems.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 23:20:34 UTC (1,634 KB)"

While addressing label noise, previous works on semi-supervised learning primarily focus on natural language understanding tasks, assuming each sample has a unique label. However, these methods are not directly applicable to SSDS, as it is a generative task, and each dialogue can be summarized in different ways. In this work, we propose a novel scoring approach, SiCF, which encapsulates three primary dimensions of summarization model quality: Semantic invariance (indicative of model confidence), Coverage (factual recall), and Faithfulness (factual precision). Using the SiCF score, we select unlabeled dialogues with high-quality generated summaries to train summarization models. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SiCF scores in uncertainty estimation and semi-supervised learning for dialogue summarization tasks.

After a short survey of this relatively recent line of work, we extend the theory of terminal embeddings to hold for arbitrary (e.g., infinite) subsets $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, and then specialize our generalized results to the case where $X$ is a low-dimensional compact submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we prove the following generalization of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: For all $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ and $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^N$, there exists a terminal embedding $f: \mathbb{R}^N \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that $$(1 - \varepsilon) \| x - y \|_2 \leq \left\| f(x) - f(y) \right\|_2 \leq (1 + \varepsilon) \| x - y \|_2 \quad \forall \, x \in X ~{\rm and}~ \forall \, y \in \mathbb{R}^N.$$ Crucially, we show that the dimension $m$ of the range of $f$ above is optimal up to multiplicative constants, satisfying $m=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \omega^2(S_X))$, where $\omega(S_X)$ is the Gaussian width of the set of unit secants of $X$, $S_X=\overline{\{(x-y)/\|x-y\|_2 \colon x \neq y \in X\}}$. Furthermore, our proofs are constructive and yield algorithms for computing a general class of terminal embeddings $f$, an instance of which is demonstrated herein to allow for more accurate compressive nearest neighbor classification than standard linear Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings do in practice.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:04:45 UTC (1,133 KB)"

His model represents an asset swap by a directed graph whose nodes are the participating parties and edges represent asset transfers, and rational behavior of the participants is captured by a preference relation between a protocol's outcomes. Asset transfers between parties are achieved using smart contracts. These smart contracts are quite involved and they require storage and processing of a large number of paths in the swap digraph, limiting practical significance of his protocol. His paper also describes a different protocol that uses only standard hash time-lock contracts (HTLC's), but this simpler protocol applies only to some special types of digraphs. He left open the question whether there is a simple and efficient protocol for cross-chain asset swaps in arbitrary digraphs. Motivated by this open problem, we conducted a comprehensive study of \emph{HTLC-based protocols}, in which all asset transfers are implemented with HTLCs. Our main contribution is a full characterization of swap digraphs that have such protocols.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:08:01 UTC (421 KB)"

In statistical settings, the goal of $k$-PCA is to identify a top eigenspace of the covariance matrix of a distribution, which we only have implicit access to via samples. Motivated by these implicit settings, we analyze black-box deflation methods as a framework for designing $k$-PCA algorithms, where we model access to the unknown target matrix via a black-box $1$-PCA oracle which returns an approximate top eigenvector, under two popular notions of approximation. Despite being arguably the most natural reduction-based approach to $k$-PCA algorithm design, such black-box methods, which recursively call a $1$-PCA oracle $k$ times, were previously poorly-understood. Our main contribution is significantly sharper bounds on the approximation parameter degradation of deflation methods for $k$-PCA. For a quadratic form notion of approximation we term ePCA (energy PCA), we show deflation methods suffer no parameter loss. For an alternative well-studied approximation notion we term cPCA (correlation PCA), we tightly characterize the parameter regimes where deflation methods are feasible. Moreover, we show that in all feasible regimes, $k$-cPCA deflation algorithms suffer no asymptotic parameter loss for any constant $k$. We apply our framework to obtain state-of-the-art $k$-PCA algorithms robust to dataset contamination, improving prior work both in sample complexity and approximation quality.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:07:20 UTC (91 KB)[v2] Thu, 7 Mar 2024 02:12:55 UTC (91 KB)"

In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of such problems, but with an additional constraint: The size difference between any two connected components of the resulting cluster graph should not exceed a given threshold. Depending on which modifications are permissible -- only adding edges, only deleting edges, both adding and deleting edges -- we have three different computational problems. We show that all three problems, when parameterized by $k$, admit single-exponential time FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels.

This natural problem generalizes the well-studied graph isomorphism problem, has many applications, and remains NP-hard even restricted to unions of paths.

However, when working with private information, like financial data or health records, outsourcing the computation might result in privacy issues. Recent advances in Privacy-Preserving Techniques (PPTs) have enabled ML training and inference over protected data through the use of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). However, these techniques are still at a preliminary stage and their application in real-world situations is demanding.

Hence, electrophysiological models dealing with cardiac conduction are critically important in the field of interdisciplinary sciences. The primary aim of this paper is to reproduce a normal sinus rhythm ECG waveform which will act as the baseline for fitting and then fit any clinical ECG waveform that does not deviate much from normal sinus rhythm. To reproduce the ECG, we modeled the pacemaker complex using three coupled van der Pol (VDP) oscillators with appropriate delays to generate the action potentials. These action potentials are responsible for the excitation of the non-pacemaker cells of the atria and ventricles whose electrical activity gets recorded as the ECG signal. The ECG signal is composed of a periodic set of individual waves corresponding to atrial and ventricular contraction and relaxation. These waves are modeled with the help of four FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations with impulses corresponding to the action potentials generated by the pacemaker cells. After the successful reproduction of a normal sinus rhythm ECG, we have developed a framework where we have used genetic algorithm (GA) to fit a given clinical ECG data with parameters belonging to the above mentioned system of delay differential equations (DDEs). The GA framework has enabled us to fit ECG data representing different cardiac conditions reasonably well.

The objective is to decide whether there is a broadcast protocol from $s$ that ensures that all the vertices of $G$ get the message in at most $t$ rounds. We consider the broadcast protocol where, in a round, any node aware of the message can forward it to at most one of its neighbors. As the number of nodes aware of the message can at most double at each round, for a non-trivial instance we have $n \le 2^t$. Hence, the brute force algorithm that checks all the permutations of the vertices runs in time $2^{2^{\calO(t)}} \cdot n^{\calO(1)}$. As our first result, we prove this simple algorithm is the best possible in the following sense. Telephone Broadcast does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(t)}} \cdot n^{\calO(1)}$, unless the √ê fails. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the fourth example of \NP-Complete problem that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.

In contrast to the standard privacy notion for these problems, which is analogous to node-privacy in graphs, our new definition gives a more fine-grained privacy guarantee, which is analogous to edge-privacy. We illustrate several scenarios of Set Cover and Max Cover where our privacy notion is desired one for the application. Our main result is an $\epsilon$-edge differentially private algorithm for Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon))$-approximation with high probability. Furthermore, we show that this result is nearly tight: we give a lower bound show that an additive error of $\Omega(k/\epsilon)$ is necessary under edge-differential privacy. Via group privacy properties, this implies a new algorithm for $\epsilon$-node differentially private Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(fk/\epsilon))$-approximation, where $f$ is the maximum degree of an element in the set system. When $f\ll k$, this improves over the best known algorithm for Max Cover under pure (node) differential privacy, which obtains an $(1-1/e,\tilde{O}(k^2/\epsilon))$-approximation.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 21:40:10 UTC (50 KB)"

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review exclusively on the topic of deep learning for performance learning of configurable software, covering 948 searched papers spanning six indexing services, based on which 85 primary papers were extracted and analyzed. Our results summarize the key topics and statistics on how the configuration data is prepared; how the deep configuration performance learning model is built; how the model is evaluated and how they are exploited in different tasks related to software configuration. We also identify the good practice and the potentially problematic phenomena from the studies surveyed, together with insights on future opportunities for the field.

In our fully-dynamic setting, points are allowed to be inserted as well as deleted, and our objective is to maintain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner that has constant bounds on its maximum degree and its lightness (the ratio of its weight to that of the minimum spanning tree), while minimizing the recourse, which is the number of edges added or removed by each point insertion or deletion. We present a fully-dynamic algorithm that handles point insertion with amortized constant recourse and point deletion with amortized $O(\log\Delta)$ recourse, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the point set.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:45:11 UTC (27 KB)"

In the last decades, researchers have made substantial effort to study the theoretical performance of SGD and its shuffling variants. However, only limited work has investigated its shuffling momentum variants, including shuffling heavy-ball momentum schemes for non-convex problems and Nesterov's momentum for convex settings. In this work, we extend the analysis of the shuffling momentum gradient method developed in [Tran et al (2021)] to both finite-sum convex and strongly convex optimization problems. We provide the first analysis of shuffling momentum-based methods for the strongly convex setting, attaining a convergence rate of $O(1/nT^2)$, where $n$ is the number of samples and $T$ is the number of training epochs. Our analysis is a state-of-the-art, matching the best rates of existing shuffling stochastic gradient algorithms in the literature.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 18:19:02 UTC (395 KB)"

Enhancements in the observed emission are common, typically lasting 1 -- 3 months, such that the average flux of material from Io is determined by the enhancements, not any quiescent state. The enhancements are not seen at periodicities associated with modulation in solar insolation of Io's surface, thus physical process(es) other than insolation-driven sublimation must ultimately drive the bulk of Io's atmospheric escape.

Once the buyers and sellers place their requests, the exchange determines how these requests are to be matched. The two most popular objectives used while determining the matching are maximizing volume at a uniform price and maximizing volume with dynamic pricing. In this work, we study the algorithmic complexity of the problems arising from these matching tasks. We present a linear time algorithm for uniform price matching which is an improvement over the previous algorithms that take $O(n\log n)$ time to match $n$ requests. For dynamic price matching, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n)$ on the running time, thereby proving that the currently known best algorithm is time-optimal.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 15:30:24 UTC (20 KB)"

In this paper, we propose the novel concept of a cover-edge set that can be used to find triangles more efficiently. Leveraging the breadth-first search (BFS) method, we can quickly generate a compact cover-edge set. Novel sequential and parallel triangle counting algorithms that employ cover-edge sets are presented. The novel sequential algorithm performs competitively with the fastest previous approaches on both real and synthetic graphs, such as those from the Graph500 Benchmark and the MIT/Amazon/IEEE Graph Challenge. We implement 22 sequential algorithms for performance evaluation and comparison. At the same time, we employ OpenMP to parallelize 11 sequential algorithms, presenting an in-depth analysis of their parallel performance. Furthermore, we develop a distributed parallel algorithm that can asymptotically reduce communication on massive graphs. In our estimate from massive-scale Graph500 graphs, our distributed parallel algorithm can reduce the communication on a scale~36 graph by 1156x and on a scale~42 graph by 2368x.

However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$, remains unclear in existing literature. This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when $k$ is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for $(k, z)$-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of $\Theta( n d )$ for terminal embedding, where $n$ represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 13:49:32 UTC (1,557 KB)[v2] Wed, 6 Mar 2024 02:05:36 UTC (797 KB)"
"54","Hamiltonian Property Testing","Andreas Bluhm, Matthias C. Caro, Aadil Oufkir","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 13:44:28 UTC (276 KB)"

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal (termed DynST) of an industry-level deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 12:31:24 UTC (7,643 KB)"

In this paper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent. By leveraging the extraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense of the corpus. The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent agents. We discuss limitations and future work for combining interactive visualization and LLMs more profoundly to better support corpus analysis.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 08:15:57 UTC (7,662 KB)"

"62","DGAP: Efficient Dynamic Graph Analysis on Persistent Memory","Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam, Dong Dai","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Dynamic graphs, featuring continuously updated vertices and edges, have grown in importance for numerous real-world applications. To accommodate this, graph frameworks, particularly their internal data structures, must support both persistent graph updates and rapid graph analysis simultaneously, leading to complex designs to orchestrate `fast but volatile' and `persistent but slow' storage devices. Emerging persistent memory technologies, such as Optane DCPMM, offer a promising alternative to simplify the designs by providing data persistence, low latency, and high IOPS together. In light of this, we propose DGAP, a framework for efficient dynamic graph analysis on persistent memory. Unlike traditional dynamic graph frameworks, which combine multiple graph data structures (e.g., edge list or adjacency list) to achieve the required performance, DGAP utilizes a single mutable Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) graph structure with new designs for persistent memory to construct the framework. Specifically, DGAP introduces a \textit{per-section edge log} to reduce write amplification on persistent memory; a \textit{per-thread undo log} to enable high-performance, crash-consistent rebalancing operations; and a data placement schema to minimize in-place updates on persistent memory. Our extensive evaluation results demonstrate that DGAP can achieve up to $3.2\times$ better graph update performance and up to $3.77\times$ better graph analysis performance compared to state-of-the-art dynamic graph frameworks for persistent memory, such as XPGraph, LLAMA, and GraphOne.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 05:40:45 UTC (5,442 KB)"

Lund, Hari Iyer","Applications (stat.AP)","Forensic experts use specialized training and knowledge to enable other members of the judicial system to make better informed and more just decisions. Factfinders, in particular, are tasked with judging how much weight to give to experts' reports and opinions. Many references describe assessing evidential weight from the perspective of a forensic expert. Some recognize that stakeholders are each responsible for evaluating their own weight of evidence. Morris (1971, 1974, 1977) provided a general framework for recipients to update their own uncertainties after learning an expert's opinion. Although this framework is normative under Bayesian axioms and several forensic scholars advocate the use of Bayesian reasoning, few resources describe its application in forensic science. This paper addresses this gap by examining how recipients can combine principles of science and Bayesian reasoning to evaluate their own likelihood ratios for expert opinions. This exercise helps clarify how an expert's role depends on whether one envisions recipients to be logical and scientific or deferential. Illustrative examples with an expert's opinion expressed as a categorical conclusion, likelihood ratio, or range of likelihood ratios, or with likelihood ratios from multiple experts, each reveal the importance and influence of validation data for logical recipients' interpretations.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 05:22:05 UTC (2,352 KB)"

Comput.'17]. We can determine Lyndon words, factorize a word into Lyndon words in lexicographically decreasing order, and find the Lyndon rotation of a word, all in linear time within constant additional working space. A recent research interest emerged from the question of what happens when we change the lexicographic order, which is at the heart of the definition of Lyndon words. In particular, the alternating order, where the order of all odd positions becomes reversed, has been recently proposed. While a Lyndon word is, among all its cyclic rotations, the smallest one with respect to the lexicographic order, a Galois word exhibits the same property by exchanging the lexicographic order with the alternating order. Unfortunately, this exchange has a large impact on the properties Galois words exhibit, which makes it a nontrivial task to translate results from Lyndon words to Galois words. Up until now, it has only been conjectured that linear-time algorithms with constant additional working space in the spirit of Duval's algorithm are possible for computing the Galois factorization or the Galois rotation. Here, we affirm this conjecture as follows. Given a word $T$ of length $n$, we can determine whether $T$ is a Galois word, in $O(n)$ time with constant additional working space. Within the same complexities, we can also determine the Galois rotation of $T$, and compute the Galois factorization of $T$ online.

We prove that there is an online algorithm that maintains a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate vertex cover in amortized $n^{1-c}\epsilon^{-C}$ time for constants $c, C > 0$ for fully dynamic updates if and only if the $\mathsf{OMv}$ conjecture is false. Similarly, we prove that there is an online algorithm that maintains a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching in amortized $n^{1-c}\epsilon^{-C}$ time if and only if there is a nontrivial algorithm for another dynamic problem, which we call dynamic approximate $\mathsf{OMv}$, that has seemingly no matching structure. This provides some evidence against achieving amortized sublinear update times for approximate fully dynamic matching and vertex cover. Leveraging these connections, we obtain faster algorithms for approximate fully dynamic matching in both the online and offline settings. 1. We give a randomized algorithm that with high probability maintains a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate bipartite matching and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate vertex cover in fully dynamic graphs, in amortized $O(\epsilon^{-O(1)} \frac{n}{2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}})$ update time. Our algorithm leverages fast algorithms for $\mathsf{OMv}$ due to Larsen-Williams [SODA 2017]. 2. We give a randomized offline algorithm for $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum matching with amortized runtime $O(n^{.58}\epsilon^{-O(1)})$ by using fast matrix multiplication, significantly improving over the runtimes achieved via online algorithms.

As demonstrated in this paper, nimCSO reaches the physical limits of the hardware (L1 cache latency) and can outperform an efficient native Python implementation over 400 times in terms of speed and 50 times in terms of memory usage (not counting interpreter), while also outperforming NumPy implementation 35 and 17 times, respectively, when checking a candidate solution. It is designed to be both (1) a user-ready tool, implementing two efficient brute-force approaches (for handling up to 25 dimensions), a custom search algorithm (for up to 40 dimensions), and a genetic algorithm (for any dimensionality), and (2) a scaffold for building even more elaborate methods in the future, including heuristics going beyond data availability.

These problems have a plethora of applications and are expressed concisely within the Pandora's Box model. Its optimal solution is the ingenious index policy proposed originally by Weitzman in 1979. In our principal-agent setting, the search task is delegated to an agent. The agent performs a sequential exploration of $n$ boxes, suffers the exploration cost for each inspected box, and selects the content (called the prize) of one inspected box as outcome. Agent and principal obtain an individual value based on the selected prize. To influence the search, the principal a-priori designs a contract with a non-negative payment to the agent for each potential prize. The goal of the principal to maximize her expected reward, i.e., value minus payment. We show how to compute optimal contracts for the principal in several scenarios. A popular and important subclass are linear contracts, and we show how to compute optimal linear contracts in polynomial time. For general contracts, we consider the standard assumption that the agent suffers cost but obtains value only from the transfers by the principal. Interestingly, a suitable adaptation of the index policy results in an optimal contract here. More generally, for general contracts with non-zero agent values for outcomes we show how to compute an optimal contract in two cases: (1) when each box has only one prize with non-zero value for principal and agent, (2) for i.i.d. boxes with a single prize with positive value for the principal. These results show that optimal contracts can be highly non-trivial, and their design goes significantly beyond the application or re-interpretation of the index policy.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:53:27 UTC (28 KB)"
"71","Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Learning Truncated Gaussians","Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Thanasis Pittas, Nikos Zarifis","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study the problem of estimating the mean of an identity covariance Gaussian in the truncated setting, in the regime when the truncation set comes from a low-complexity family $\mathcal{C}$ of sets. Specifically, for a fixed but unknown truncation set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we are given access to samples from the distribution $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{ \mu}, \mathbf{ I})$ truncated to the set $S$. The goal is to estimate $\boldsymbol\mu$ within accuracy $\epsilon>0$ in $\ell_2$-norm. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound suggesting a super-polynomial information-computation gap for this task. In more detail, we show that the complexity of any SQ algorithm for this problem is $d^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$, even when the class $\mathcal{C}$ is simple so that $\mathrm{poly}(d/\epsilon)$ samples information-theoretically suffice. Concretely, our SQ lower bound applies when $\mathcal{C}$ is a union of a bounded number of rectangles whose VC dimension and Gaussian surface are small. As a corollary of our construction, it also follows that the complexity of the previously known algorithm for this task is qualitatively best possible.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:30:33 UTC (43 KB)"

Among the 25 Colombian institutions identified as participants in at least one publication, the contributions of four universities stand out: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad de Antioquia, with 104, 78, 68, and 67 publications, respectively. By cross-referencing information from ADS and WoS, we found that the areas with the greatest impact in publications are threefold: high-energy and fundamental physics, stars and stellar physics, and galaxies and cosmology. Globally, according to WoS, Colombia ranks 52nd in the number of peer-reviewed publications between 2019 and 2023, and fifth in Latin America. Additionally, we identified three highly cited publications (top 1% worldwide) belonging to the field of observational cosmology.

In sparse Erd≈ës--R√©nyi graphs, it is known that a linear-time algorithm of Karp and Sipser achieves near-optimal matching sizes asymptotically almost surely, giving a law-of-large numbers for the matching sizes of such graphs in terms of solutions to an ODE. We provide an extension of this analysis, identifying broad ranges of stochastic block model parameters for which the Karp--Sipser algorithm achieves near-optimal matching sizes, but demonstrating that it cannot perform optimally on general SBM instances. We also consider the problem of constructing a matching online, in which the vertices of one half of a bipartite stochastic block model arrive one-at-a-time, and must be matched as they arrive. We show that the competitive ratio lower bound of 0.837 found by Mastin and Jaillet for the Erd≈ës--R√©nyi case is tight whenever the expected degrees in all communities are equal. We propose several linear-time algorithms for online matching in the general stochastic block model, but prove that despite very good experimental performance, none of these achieve online asymptotic optimality.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 15:50:17 UTC (2,480 KB)"

We adapt the variational graph auto-encoder approach to the bipartite case, which enables us to generate embeddings in a latent space where the two sets of nodes are positioned based on their probability of connection. We translate the fairness framework commonly considered in sociology in order to address sampling bias in ecology. By incorporating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as an additional penalty term in the loss we optimize, we ensure that the structure of the latent space is independent of continuous variables, which are related to the sampling process. Finally, we show how our approach can change our understanding of ecological networks when applied to the Spipoll data set, a citizen science monitoring program of plant-pollinator interactions to which many observers contribute, making it prone to sampling bias.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 13:12:02 UTC (1,260 KB)"

This list $L$ might also include circuits that are spurious: they either do not correspond to factors of $f$ or are not even well-defined, e.g. the input to a division gate is a sub-circuit that computes the identically zero polynomial. The key technical ingredient of our algorithm is a notion of the pseudo-resultant of $f$ and a factor $g$, which serves as a proxy for the resultant of $g$ and $f/g$, with the advantage that the circuit complexity of the pseudo-resultant is comparable to that of the circuit complexity of $f$ and $g$. This notion, which might be of independent interest, together with the recent results of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas, helps us derandomize one key step of multivariate polynomial factorization algorithms - that of deterministically finding a good starting point for Newton Iteration for the case when the input polynomial as well as the irreducible factor of interest have small constant-depth circuits.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 12:09:16 UTC (43 KB)"

Here we focus on the uniform random generation of those graphs with n vertices, including k on the main branch, for which we provide three algorithms, for three different use-cases. The first, based on rejection, is efficient when aiming for small values of k (more precisely whenever k = O($\sqrt$ n)).

This problem also has a hidden input $E_* \subsetneq E$ of cardinality at most $k$ representing blocked edges. The objective is to travel from $s$ to $t$ with the minimum distance. At the beginning of the walk, the blockages $E_*$ are unknown: the traveller discovers that an edge is blocked when visiting one of its endpoints. Online algorithms, also called strategies, have been proposed for this problem and assessed with the competitive ratio, i.e. the ratio between the distance actually traversed by the traveller divided by the distance we would have traversed knowing the blockages in advance. Even though the optimal competitive ratio is $2k+1$ even on unit-weighted planar graphs of treewidth 2, we design a polynomial-time strategy achieving competitive ratio $9$ on unit-weighted outerplanar graphs. This value $9$ also stands as a lower bound for this family of graphs as we prove that, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, no strategy can achieve a competitive ratio $9-\varepsilon$.

Vertex integrity is the smallest number $\iota$ such that there is a set $S$ of $\iota' \le \iota$ vertices such that every connected component of $G-S$ contains at most $\iota-\iota'$ vertices. It is known that the vertex integrity lies between the well-studied parameters vertex cover number and tree-depth. Alon and Yuster [ESA 2007] designed algorithms for graphs with small vertex cover number using fast matrix multiplications. We demonstrate that fast matrix multiplication can also be effectively used when parameterizing by vertex integrity $\iota$ by developing efficient algorithms for problems including an $O(\iota^{\omega-1}n)$-time algorithm for computing the girth of a graph, randomized $O(\iota^{\omega - 1}n)$-time algorithms for Maximum Matching and for finding any induced four-vertex subgraph except for a clique or an independent set, and an $O(\iota^{(\omega-1)/2}n^2) \subseteq O(\iota^{0.687} n^2)$-time algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths.

The goal is to partition the input points into neighborhood-preserving shards, so that the nearest neighbors of any point are contained in only a few shards. When a query arrives, a routing algorithm is used to identify the shards which should be searched for its nearest neighbors. This approach forms the backbone of distributed ANNS, where the dataset is so large that it must be split across multiple machines. In this paper, we design simple and highly efficient routing methods, and prove strong theoretical guarantees on their performance. A crucial characteristic of our routing algorithms is that they are inherently modular, and can be used with any partitioning method. This addresses a key drawback of prior approaches, where the routing algorithms are inextricably linked to their associated partitioning method. In particular, our new routing methods enable the use of balanced graph partitioning, which is a high-quality partitioning method without a naturally associated routing algorithm. Thus, we provide the first methods for routing using balanced graph partitioning that are extremely fast to train, admit low latency, and achieve high recall. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our full partitioning and routing pipeline on billion-scale datasets, where it outperforms existing scalable partitioning methods by significant margins, achieving up to 2.14x higher QPS at 90% recall$@10$ than the best competitor.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 07:37:09 UTC (1,410 KB)"

It is necessary to carry out subgraph enumeration while protecting users' privacy from any potential attacker as the count of subgraph may contain sensitive information. Most recent studies focus on the privacy protection algorithms based on edge LDP (Local Differential Privacy). However, these algorithms suffer a large estimation error due to the great amount of required noise. In this paper, we propose a novel idea of k-stars LDP and a novel k-stars LDP algorithm for (p, q)-clique enumeration with a small estimation error, where a k-stars is a star-shaped graph with k nodes connecting to one node. The effectiveness of edge LDP relies on its capacity to obfuscate the existence of an edge between the user and his one-hop neighbors. This is based on the premise that a user should be aware of the existence of his one-hop neighbors. Similarly, we can apply this premise to k-stars as well, where an edge is a specific genre of 1-stars. Based on this fact, we first propose the k-stars neighboring list to enable our algorithm to obfuscate the existence of k-stars with Warner' s RR. Then, we propose the absolute value correction technique and the k-stars sampling technique to further reduce the estimation error. Finally, with the two-round user-collector interaction mechanism, we propose our k-stars LDP algorithm to count the number of (p, q)-clique while successfully protecting users' privacy. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments have showed the superiority of our algorithm over the algorithms based on edge LDP.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 07:30:10 UTC (3,763 KB)"

Simpson","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Parameter inference and uncertainty quantification are important steps when relating mathematical models to real-world observations, and when estimating uncertainty in model predictions. However, methods for doing this can be computationally expensive, particularly when the number of unknown model parameters is large. The aim of this study is to develop and test an efficient profile likelihood-based method, which takes advantage of the structure of the mathematical model being used. We do this by identifying specific parameters that affect model output in a known way, such as a linear scaling. We illustrate the method by applying it to three caricature models from different areas of the life sciences: (i) a predator-prey model from ecology; (ii) a compartment-based epidemic model from health sciences; and, (iii) an advection-diffusion-reaction model describing transport of dissolved solutes from environmental science. We show that the new method produces results of comparable accuracy to existing profile likelihood methods, but with substantially fewer evaluations of the forward model. We conclude that our method could provide a much more efficient approach to parameter inference for models where a structure approach is feasible. Code to apply the new method to user-supplied models and data is provided via a publicly accessible repository.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 02:13:58 UTC (289 KB)"
"86","Limits to classification performance by relating Kullback-Leibler divergence to Cohen's Kappa","L. Crow, S. J. Watts","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","The performance of machine learning classification algorithms are evaluated by estimating metrics, often from the confusion matrix, using training data and cross-validation. However, these do not prove that the best possible performance has been achieved. Fundamental limits to error rates can be estimated using information distance measures. To this end, the confusion matrix has been formulated to comply with the Chernoff-Stein Lemma. This links the error rates to the Kullback-Leibler divergences between the probability density functions describing the two classes. This leads to a key result that relates Cohen's Kappa to the Resistor Average Distance which is the parallel resistor combination of the two Kullback-Leibler divergences. The Resistor Average Distance has units of bits and is estimated from the same training data used by the classification algorithm, using kNN estimates of the KullBack-Leibler divergences. The classification algorithm gives the confusion matrix and Kappa. Theory and methods are discussed in detail and then applied to Monte Carlo data and real datasets. Four very different real datasets - Breast Cancer, Coronary Heart Disease, Bankruptcy, and Particle Identification - are analysed, with both continuous and discrete values, and their classification performance compared to the expected theoretical limit. In all cases this analysis shows that the algorithms could not have performed any better due to the underlying probability density functions for the two classes. Important lessons are learnt on how to predict the performance of algorithms for imbalanced data using training datasets that are approximately balanced. Machine learning is very powerful but classification performance ultimately depends on the quality of the data and the relevance of the variables to the problem.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 17:36:42 UTC (4,596 KB)"

Given a capacity $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, and a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where each vertex has a size in $\{0,1, \ldots,k\}$, we seek a collection of subsets of vertices $S_1, \ldots, S_m$ that cover all the vertices, such that for any $1 \leq j \leq m$, the total size of vertices in $S_j$ is bounded by $k$, and there are no edges from $V \setminus S_j$ to $S_j$. The objective is to minimize the number of subsets $m$. CPO is closely related to the rule caching problem (RCP) that is of wide interest in the networking area. The input for RCP is a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, a profit function $p:V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{0}^+$, and $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The output is a subset $S \subseteq V$ of maximum profit such that $|S| \leq k$ and there are no edges from $V \setminus S$ to $S$. Our main result is a $2$-approximation algorithm for CPO on out-trees, complemented by an asymptotic $1.5$-hardness of approximation result. We also give a two-way reduction between RCP and the densest $k$-subhypergraph problem, surprisingly showing that the problems are equivalent w.r.t. polynomial-time approximation within any factor $\rho \geq 1$. This implies that RCP cannot be approximated within factor $|V|^{1-\eps}$ for any fixed $\eps>0$, under standard complexity assumptions. Prior to this work, RCP was just known to be strongly NP-hard. We further show that there is no EPTAS for the special case of RCP where the profits are uniform, assuming Gap-ETH. Since this variant admits a PTAS, we essentially resolve the complexity status of this problem.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 17:17:08 UTC (227 KB)"

The insightful elements of this algorithm are the ciphering and deciphering algorithms of Playfair, Caesar, and Vigenere. Only a few of their main properties are taken and modified, with the aim of forming a specific functionality of the algorithm called Latin Djokovic. Specifically, a string is entered as input data. A key k is given, with a random value between the values a and b = a + 3. The obtained value is stored in a variable with the aim of being constant during the run of the algorithm. In correlation to the given key, the string is divided into several groups of substrings, and each substring has a length of k characters. The next step involves encoding each substring from the list of existing substrings. Encoding is performed using the basis of the Caesar algorithm, i.e., shifting with k characters. However, that k is incremented by 1 when moving to the next substring in that list. When the value of k becomes greater than b + 1, it will return to its initial value. The algorithm is executed, following the same procedure, until the last substring in the list is traversed. Using this polyalphabetic method, ciphering and deciphering of strings are achieved. The algorithm also works for a 100-character string. The x character is not used when the number of characters in a substring is incompatible with the expected length. The algorithm is simple to implement, but it is questionable if it works better than the other methods from the point of view of execution time and storage space.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 09:59:21 UTC (601 KB)"

These models generate predictive probability density functions (pdfs), and the objective is to integrate them systematically, employing both linear and log-linear pooling. We introduce novel approaches for log-linear pooling, determining input-dependent weights for the predictive pdfs of the Gaussian processes. The aggregation of the pdfs is realized through Monte Carlo sampling, drawing samples of weights from their posterior. The performance of these methods, as well as those based on linear pooling, is demonstrated using a synthetic dataset.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 04:21:21 UTC (770 KB)"

For a point set $S$, the map $\varphi_\ell:\mathbb{R}^d \to N^{-1/2}\{-1,1\}^N$ has the property that storing $\varphi_\ell(S)$ (a \emph{sketch} of $S$) allows one to report pairwise squared distances between points in $S$ up to some multiplicative $(1\pm \epsilon)$ error with high probability as long as the minimum distance is not too small compared to $\epsilon$. The maps $\varphi_\ell$ are the $\ell$-fold composition of a certain type of random feature mapping. Moreover, we determine how large $N$ needs to be as a function of $\epsilon$ and other parameters of the point set. Compared to existing techniques, our maps offer several advantages. The standard method for compressing point sets by random mappings relies on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma which implies that if a set of $n$ points is mapped by a Gaussian random matrix to $\mathbb{R}^k$ with $k =\Theta(\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$, then pairwise distances between points are preserved up to a multiplicative $(1\pm \epsilon)$ error with high probability. The main advantage of our maps $\varphi_\ell$ over random linear maps is that ours map point sets directly into the discrete cube $N^{-1/2}\{-1,1\}^N$ and so there is no additional step needed to convert the sketch to bits. For some range of parameters, our maps $\varphi_\ell$ produce sketches which require fewer bits of storage space.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 22:24:31 UTC (21 KB)"

V. Williams and R.~R.~Williams (2018).This invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014). - the $O(m^{4/3})$ runtime invalidates a conjecture of A.~Abboud and V. V. Williams (FOCS 2014) that any combinatorial algorithm for triangle detection requires $m^{3/2 - o(1)}$ time. - as a direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the $k$-clique problem, surpassing an almost $40$ years old algorithm of Ne{≈°}et{≈ô}il and Poljak (1985). This result strongly disproves the combinatorial $k$-clique conjecture. - as another direct application of the triangle detection algorithm, we obtain a faster exact algorithm for the \textsc{Max-Cut} problem, surpassing an almost $20$ years old algorithm of R.~R.~Williams (2005).","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 04:01:26 UTC (23 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 15:14:48 UTC (1 KB) (withdrawn)"

However, many educators may lack the necessary training and expertise in data science to teach these skills. To address this gap, we created the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP), bringing together graduate students and physics educators from different institutions and backgrounds to share best practices and lessons learned in integrating data science into undergraduate physics education. In this article, we present insights and experiences from this community of practice, highlighting key strategies and challenges in incorporating data science into the introductory physics curriculum.

The instrument is built from consumer off-the-shelf astronomical equipment, assembled inside a shipping container, and deployed alongside the Argus Pathfinder at a dark sky observing site in Western North Carolina. The \$35k prototype ArgusSpec was designed, built, and deployed in under a year, largely from existing parts, and has been operating on-sky since March 2023. With current hardware and software, the system is capable of receiving an observation, slewing, performing autonomous slit acquisition, and beginning data acquisition within an average of 32 s. With Argus Pathfinder's 1-second-cadence survey reporting alerts of rising sources within 2 s of onset, ArgusSpec can reach new targets well within a minute of the start of the event. As built, ArgusSpec can observe targets down to a 20$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $m_V$~13 at 30 s cadence with an optical resolution of R~150 (at 500 nm). With automated rapid acquisition demonstrated, later hardware upgrades will significantly improve the limiting magnitude, and potentially enable deep spectroscopy by the coaddition of data from an array of ArgusSpec systems. ArgusSpec's primary science driver is the characterization of the blackbody evolution of flares from nearby M-dwarfs. Large flares emitted by these stars could have significant impacts on the potential habitability of any orbiting exoplanets, but our current understanding of these events is in large part built on observations from a handful of active stars. ArgusSpec will characterize large numbers of flares, building a spectroscopic library of the most extreme events from a wide variety of stellar masses and ages.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:00:00 UTC (15,403 KB)"

To truly make conceptual contributions, researchers need to be capable of understanding the AI-generated structures and extracting the underlying concepts and ideas. When algorithms provide little explanatory reasoning alongside the output, scientists have to reverse-engineer the fundamental insights behind proposals based solely on examples. This task can be challenging as the output is often highly complex and thus not immediately accessible to humans. In this work we show how transferring part of the analysis process into an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment can assist researchers in developing an understanding of AI-generated solutions. We demonstrate the usefulness of VR in finding interpretable configurations of abstract graphs, representing Quantum Optics experiments. Thereby, we can manually discover new generalizations of AI-discoveries as well as new understanding in experimental quantum optics. Furthermore, it allows us to customize the search space in an informed way - as a human-in-the-loop - to achieve significantly faster subsequent discovery iterations. As concrete examples, with this technology, we discover a new resource-efficient 3-dimensional entanglement swapping scheme, as well as a 3-dimensional 4-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-state analyzer. Our results show the potential of VR for increasing a human researcher's ability to derive knowledge from graph-based generative AI that, which is a common abstract data representation used in diverse fields of science.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:48:01 UTC (12,146 KB)"

However, given their training on human (created) data, LLMs can inherit both societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to cognitive bias. Such human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive sciences, we develop a dataset containing 16,800 prompts to evaluate different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, amidst proposing a novel method using LLMs to debias their own prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture on the presence and effects of cognitive bias across different commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our self-help debiasing effectively mitigate cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias type.","Sun, 25 Feb 2024 02:35:56 UTC (7,208 KB)"

Reinforcement learning with agents in a 3D world could still face challenges: the knowledge required to use a simulation software as well as the utilization of a standalone simulation software in unattended training pipelines. In this paper we review tools and approaches to train reinforcement learning agents for robots in 3D worlds with respect to the robot Robotino and argue that the separation of the simulation environment for creators of virtual worlds and the model development environment for data scientists is not a well covered topic. Often both are the same and data scientists require knowledge of the simulation software to work directly with their APIs. Moreover, sometimes creators of virtual worlds and data scientists even work on the same files. We want to contribute to that topic by describing an approach where data scientists don't require knowledge about the simulation software. Our approach uses the standalone simulation software Webots, the Robot Operating System to communicate with simulated robots as well as the simulation software itself and container technology to separate the simulation from the model development environment. We put emphasize on the APIs the data scientists work with and the use of a standalone simulation software in unattended training pipelines.

Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets. We develop coresets for their use in alternating IRT training algorithms, facilitating scalable learning from large data.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 17:12:53 UTC (393 KB)"

The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties. In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar√©-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer erasure problem at the nanoscale.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 17:10:51 UTC (2,279 KB)"
"106","Undercomplete Decomposition of Symmetric Tensors in Linear Time, and Smoothed Analysis of the Condition Number","Pascal Koiran, Subhayan Saha","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the form $T = \sum_{i=1}^r u_i^{\otimes 3}$ where $T$ is a symmetric tensor of order 3 and $u_i \in \mathbb{C}^n$.In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from $u_i$. In this paper we assume that the $u_i$ are linearly independent. This implies $r \leq n$,that is, the decomposition of T is undercomplete. We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem in the exact arithmetic model of computation: Let $T$ be an order-3 symmetric tensor that has an undercomplete decomposition.Then given some $T'$ close to $T$, an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$, and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors $u'_i$ such that $||u_i - u'_i|| \leq \varepsilon$ (up to permutation and multiplication by cube roots of unity) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are: 1) We provide the first algorithm for this problem that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. More specifically, it requires $O(n^3)$ arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters $\varepsilon =$ 1/poly(n) and B = poly(n). 2) Our algorithm is robust, that is, it can handle inverse-quasi-polynomial noise (in $n$,B,$\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) in the input tensor. 3) We present a smoothed analysis of the condition number of the tensor decomposition problem. This guarantees that the condition number is low with high probability and further shows that our algorithm runs in linear time, except for some rare badly conditioned inputs. Our main algorithm is a reduction to the complete case ($r=n$) treated in our previous work [Koiran,Saha,CIAC 2023]. For efficiency reasons we cannot use this algorithm as a blackbox. Instead, we show that it can be run on an implicitly represented tensor obtained from the input tensor by a change of basis.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 16:22:39 UTC (39 KB)"

However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data. Furthermore, the bias can be calculated analytically for this estimator. Here this estimator is described and is tested on simulated data.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 14:28:00 UTC (319 KB)"

For some problems, we know the optimal running time, assuming certain conditional lower bounds. In this work, we study the $d$-dimensional geometric knapsack problem where we are far from this level of understanding. We are given a set of weighted d-dimensional geometric items like squares, rectangles, or hypercubes and a knapsack which is a square or a (hyper-)cube. We want to select a subset of items that fit non-overlappingly inside the knapsack, maximizing the total profit of the packed items. We make a significant step towards determining the best running time for solving these problems approximately by presenting approximation algorithms with near-linear running times for any constant dimension d and any constant parameter $\epsilon$. For (hyper)-cubes, we present a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm whose running time drastically improves upon the known $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which has a running time where the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$ and $d$. Moreover, we present a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for rectangles in the setting without rotations and a $(17/9+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm if we allow rotations by 90 degrees. The best known polynomial time algorithms for these settings have approximation ratios of $17/9+\epsilon$ and $1.5+\epsilon$, respectively, and running times in which the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$. We also give dynamic algorithms with polylogarithmic query and update times and the same approximation guarantees as the algorithms above. Key to our results is a new family of structured packings which we call easily guessable packings. They are flexible enough to guarantee profitable solutions and structured enough so that we can compute these solutions quickly.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 13:49:27 UTC (319 KB)"

This paper traces the evolution of tokenizers from word-level to subword-level, analyzing how they balance tokens and types to enhance model adaptability while controlling complexity. Despite subword tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) overcoming many word tokenizer limitations, they encounter difficulties in handling non-Latin languages and depend heavily on extensive training data and computational resources to grasp the nuances of multiword expressions (MWEs). This article argues that tokenizers, more than mere technical tools, should drawing inspiration from the cognitive science about human language processing. This study then introduces the ""Principle of Least Effort"" from cognitive science, that humans naturally seek to reduce cognitive effort, and discusses the benefits of this principle for tokenizer development. Based on this principle, the paper proposes that the Less-is-Better (LiB) model could be a new approach for LLM tokenizer. The LiB model can autonomously learn an integrated vocabulary consisting of subwords, words, and MWEs, which effectively reduces both the numbers of tokens and types. Comparative evaluations show that the LiB tokenizer outperforms existing word and BPE tokenizers, presenting an innovative method for tokenizer development, and hinting at the possibility of future cognitive science-based tokenizers being more efficient.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:03:07 UTC (610 KB)"

However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near. It is imperative that public health urgently focuses on updating its educational approaches, workforce strategies, data governance, and organizational culture to proactively meet the challenges of quantum disruption thereby becoming quantum ready.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 20:55:56 UTC (625 KB)"
"118","Future of Pandemic Prevention and Response CCC Workshop Report","David Danks, Rada Mihalcea, Katie Siek, Mona Singh, Brian Dixon, Haley Griffin","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","This report summarizes the discussions and conclusions of a 2-day multidisciplinary workshop that brought together researchers and practitioners in healthcare, computer science, and social sciences to explore what lessons were learned and what actions, primarily in research, could be taken. One consistent observation was that there is significant merit in thinking not only about pandemic situations, but also about peacetime advances, as many healthcare networks and communities are now in a perpetual state of crisis. Attendees discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic amplified gaps in our health and computing systems, and how current and future computing technologies could fill these gaps and improve the trajectory of the next pandemic. Three major computing themes emerged from the workshop: models, data, and infrastructure. Computational models are extremely important during pandemics, from anticipating supply needs of hospitals, to determining the care capacity of hospital and social service providers, to projecting the spread of the disease. Accurate, reliable models can save lives, and inform community leaders on policy decisions. Health system users require accurate, reliable data to achieve success when applying models. This requires data and measurement standardization across health care organizations, modernizing the data infrastructure, and methods for ensuring data remains private while shared for model development, validation, and application. Finally, many health care systems lack the data, compute, and communication infrastructures required to build models on their data, use those models in ordinary operations, or even to reliably access their data. Robust and timely computing research has the potential to better support healthcare works to save lives in times of crisis (e.g., pandemics) and today during relative peacetime.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:54:22 UTC (1,831 KB)"

While data-driven methods have been well established to discover novel materials faster than Edisonian trial-and-error approaches, their benefits have not been quantified. Our approach demonstrates a potential reduction in discovery time by approximately 75 %, equivalent to a 15 year acceleration in material innovation. Our pipeline enables us to extract data from more than 3300 papers which is ~5 times larger than similar data sets reported by others. We also trained machine learning models to predict the power conversion efficiency and used our model to identify promising donor-acceptor combinations that are as yet unreported. We thus demonstrate a workflow that goes from published literature to extracted material property data which in turn is used to obtain data-driven insights. Our insights include active learning strategies that can simultaneously optimize the material system and train strong predictive models of material properties. This work provides a valuable framework for research in material science.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:54:46 UTC (5,391 KB)"
"120","Statistical Estimation in the Spiked Tensor Model via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm","Leo Zhou, Joao Basso, Song Mei","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a general-purpose algorithm for combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the QAOA on a statistical estimation problem, namely, the spiked tensor model, which exhibits a statistical-computational gap classically. We prove that the weak recovery threshold of $1$-step QAOA matches that of $1$-step tensor power iteration. Additional heuristic calculations suggest that the weak recovery threshold of $p$-step QAOA matches that of $p$-step tensor power iteration when $p$ is a fixed constant. This further implies that multi-step QAOA with tensor unfolding could achieve, but not surpass, the classical computation threshold $\Theta(n^{(q-2)/4})$ for spiked $q$-tensors. Meanwhile, we characterize the asymptotic overlap distribution for $p$-step QAOA, finding an intriguing sine-Gaussian law verified through simulations. For some $p$ and $q$, the QAOA attains an overlap that is larger by a constant factor than the tensor power iteration overlap. Of independent interest, our proof techniques employ the Fourier transform to handle difficult combinatorial sums, a novel approach differing from prior QAOA analyses on spin-glass models without planted structure.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:50:28 UTC (1,149 KB)"
"121","Higher-Order Networks Representation and Learning: A Survey","Hao Tian, Reza Zafarani","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Network data has become widespread, larger, and more complex over the years. Traditional network data is dyadic, capturing the relations among pairs of entities. With the need to model interactions among more than two entities, significant research has focused on higher-order networks and ways to represent, analyze, and learn from them. There are two main directions to studying higher-order networks. One direction has focused on capturing higher-order patterns in traditional (dyadic) graphs by changing the basic unit of study from nodes to small frequently observed subgraphs, called motifs. As most existing network data comes in the form of pairwise dyadic relationships, studying higher-order structures within such graphs may uncover new insights. The second direction aims to directly model higher-order interactions using new and more complex representations such as simplicial complexes or hypergraphs. Some of these models have long been proposed, but improvements in computational power and the advent of new computational techniques have increased their popularity. Our goal in this paper is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive summary of the advanced higher-order network analysis techniques. We provide a systematic review of its foundations and algorithms, along with use cases and applications of higher-order networks in various scientific domains.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:11:25 UTC (99 KB)"

We study interesting generalizations of this classical problem involving scenarios. In our model, a scenario is defined as a subset of a predefined and fully specified set of jobs. The aim is to find an assignment of the whole set of jobs to identical parallel machines such that the schedule, obtained for the given scenarios by simply skipping the jobs not in the scenario, optimizes a function of the total completion times over all scenarios. While the underlying scheduling problem without scenarios can be solved efficiently by a simple greedy procedure (SPT rule), scenarios, in general, make the problem NP-hard. We paint an almost complete picture of the evolving complexity landscape, drawing the line between easy and hard. One of our main algorithmic contributions relies on a deep structural result on the maximum imbalance of an optimal schedule, based on a subtle connection to Hilbert bases of a related convex cone.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:31:15 UTC (312 KB)"

Here, we report a breakthrough in path integral Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to unravel this intricate interplay for light elements without nodal restrictions. This new capability gives us access to electronic correlations previously unattainable.

"126","Rahmani Sort: A Novel Variant of Insertion Sort Algorithm with O(nlogn) Complexity","Mohammad Khalid Imam Rahmani","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","Various decision support systems are available that implement Data Mining and Data Warehousing techniques for diving into the sea of data for getting useful patterns of knowledge (pearls). Classification, regression, clustering, and many other algorithms are used to enhance the precision and accuracy of the decision process. So, there is scope for increasing the response time of the decision process, especially in mission-critical operations. If data are ordered with suitable and efficient sorting operation, the response time of the decision process can be minimized. Insertion sort is much more suitable for such applications due to its simple and straight logic along with its dynamic nature suitable for list implementation. But it is slower than merge sort and quick sort. The main reasons this is slow: firstly, a sequential search is used to find the actual position of the next key element into the sorted left subarray and secondly, shifting of elements is required by one position towards the right for accommodating the newly inserted element. Therefore, I propose a new algorithm by using a novel technique of binary search mechanism for finding the sorted location of the next key item into the previously sorted left subarray much quicker than the conventional insertion sort algorithm. Performance measurement in terms of the actual running time of the new algorithm has been compared with those of other conventional sorting algorithms apart from the insertion sort. The results obtained on various sample data show that the new algorithm is better in performance than the conventional insertion sort and merge sort algorithms.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:38:57 UTC (343 KB)"
"127","On the Improvement of Predictive Modeling Using Bayesian Stacking and Posterior Predictive Checking","Mariana Nold, Florian Meinfelder, David Kaplan","Methodology (stat.ME)","Model uncertainty is pervasive in real world analysis situations and is an often-neglected issue in applied statistics. However, standard approaches to the research process do not address the inherent uncertainty in model building and, thus, can lead to overconfident and misleading analysis interpretations. One strategy to incorporate more flexible models is to base inferences on predictive modeling. This approach provides an alternative to existing explanatory models, as inference is focused on the posterior predictive distribution of the response variable. Predictive modeling can advance explanatory ambitions in the social sciences and in addition enrich the understanding of social phenomena under investigation. Bayesian stacking is a methodological approach rooted in Bayesian predictive modeling. In this paper, we outline the method of Bayesian stacking but add to it the approach of posterior predictive checking (PPC) as a means of assessing the predictive quality of those elements of the stacking ensemble that are important to the research question. Thus, we introduce a viable workflow for incorporating PPC into predictive modeling using Bayesian stacking without presuming the existence of a true model. We apply these tools to the PISA 2018 data to investigate potential inequalities in reading competency with respect to gender and socio-economic background. Our empirical example serves as rough guideline for practitioners who want to implement the concepts of predictive modeling and model uncertainty in their work to similar research questions.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:19:48 UTC (81 KB)"

This study investigates the potential of machine-learning models to extract structural features from mesoscale non-ordered self-assembled structures, and suggests a methodology in which machine-learning models for the structural analysis of self-assembled structures are trained on particle types and coordinate data. In the proposed approach, graph neural networks are utilised to extract local structural data for analysis. In simulations using several hundred self-assembled structures of up to 4050 coarse-grained particles, local structures are successfully extracted and classified with up to 78.35 % accuracy. As the machine-learning models learn structural characteristics without the need for human-made feature engineering, the proposed method has important potential applications in the field of materials science.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 10:29:05 UTC (1,252 KB)"

It plays a crucial role in various domains, including social network analysis, biological network analysis, recommendation systems, and community detection.

To address this problem, we studied the Member Selection Problem and extended it with a dynamic constraint variant. By incorporating dynamic constraints, our algorithm can adapt to changing conditions or requirements, allowing for more flexible and personalized subgraph extraction. This approach enables the algorithm to provide tailored solutions that meet specific needs, even in scenarios where constraints may vary over time. We also provide the theoretical analysis to show that our algorithm is 1/3-approximation. Eventually, the experiments show that our algorithm is effective and efficient in tackling the member selection problem with dynamic constraints.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 06:01:57 UTC (921 KB)"

The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 19:38:15 UTC (36,980 KB)"

Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in two aspects, both for fully dynamic algorithms and even decremental algorithms. First, no existing algorithm with worst-case update time guarantees a $o(n)$-approximation while also achieving an $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$ update and $n^{o(1)}$ query time, while our algorithm offers a constant $O_{\epsilon}(1)$-approximation with $n^{\epsilon}$ update time and $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)$ query time. Second, even if amortized update time is allowed, it is the first deterministic constant-approximation algorithm with $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ update and query time. The best result in this direction is the recent deterministic distance oracle by Chuzhoy and Zhang [STOC 2023] which achieves an approximation of $(\log\log n)^{2^{O(1/\epsilon^{3})}}$ with amortized update time of $n^{\epsilon}$ and query time of $2^{{\rm poly}(1/\epsilon)}\log n\log\log n$.

Signatures and their associated generation problems have given rise to new yet promising research questions in algorithmic enumeration. In a recent paper, B√©rczi et al. interestingly proved that generating signatures of a CNF is tractable despite the fact that verifying a solution is hard. They also showed the hardness of finding maximal signatures of an arbitrary CNF due to the intractability of satisfiability in general. Their contribution leaves open the problem of efficiently generating maximal signatures for tractable classes of CNFs, i.e., those for which satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time. Stepping into that direction, we completely characterize the complexity of generating all, minimal, and maximal signatures for XOR-CNFs.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:22:03 UTC (101 KB)"

We demonstrate strictly superior performance of our proposed CI test compared to existing approaches on path-space. Then, we develop constraint-based causal discovery algorithms for acyclic stochastic dynamical systems (allowing for loops) that leverage temporal information to recover the entire directed graph. Assuming faithfulness and a CI oracle, our algorithm is sound and complete.

We consider a variant of this problem where reassignments are allowed and extend it by a notion of current time, which is decoupled from the job arrival events. As jobs appear, the current point in time gradually advances. Jobs that are assigned to the current time unit become processed, which fixes part of the matching and disables these jobs or slots for reassignments in future steps. We refer to these time-dependent restrictions on reassignments as the over-time property. We show that FirstFit with reassignments according to the shortest augmenting path rule is $\frac{2}{3}$-competitive with respect to the matching cardinality, and that the bound is tight. Interestingly, this bound holds even if the number of reassignments per job is bound by a constant. For the number of reassignments performed by the algorithm, we show that it is in $\Omega(n \log n)$ in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of patients or jobs on the online side. This result is in line with lower bounds for the number of reassignments in online bipartite matching with reassignments, and, similarly to this previous work, we also conjecture that this bound should be tight. Known upper bounds like the $O(n \log^2 n)$ for online bipartite matching with reassignments by Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg do not transfer directly: while our interval constraints simplify the problem, the over-time property restricts the set of possible reassignments.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:44:10 UTC (26 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 17:41:52 UTC (26 KB)"

While traditionally scientific models are derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet, this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:52:58 UTC (9,514 KB)"

In the online setting, Bar-Noy, Motwani and Naor (IPL'92) conjectured that a $(1+o(1))\Delta$-edge-coloring can be computed online in $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. Numerous algorithms made progress on this question, using a higher number of colors or assuming restricted arrival models, such as random-order edge arrivals or vertex arrivals (e.g., AGKM FOCS'03, BMM SODA'10, CPW FOCS'19, BGW SODA'21, KLSST STOC'22). In this work, we resolve this longstanding conjecture in the affirmative in the most general setting of adversarial edge arrivals. We further generalize this result to obtain online counterparts of the list edge coloring result of Kahn (J. Comb. Theory. A'96) and of the recent ""local"" edge coloring result of Christiansen (STOC'23).","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:03:59 UTC (183 KB)"
"141","Fractional Linear Matroid Matching is in quasi-NC","Rohit Gurjar, Taihei Oki, Roshan Raj","Computational Complexity (cs.CC)","The matching and linear matroid intersection problems are solvable in quasi-NC, meaning that there exist deterministic algorithms that run in polylogarithmic time and use quasi-polynomially many parallel processors. However, such a parallel algorithm is unknown for linear matroid matching, which generalizes both of these problems. In this work, we propose a quasi-NC algorithm for fractional linear matroid matching, which is a relaxation of linear matroid matching and commonly generalizes fractional matching and linear matroid intersection. Our algorithm builds upon the connection of fractional matroid matching to non-commutative Edmonds' problem recently revealed by Oki and Soma~(2023). As a corollary, we also solve black-box non-commutative Edmonds' problem with rank-two skew-symmetric coefficients.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 12:12:37 UTC (28 KB)"
"142","Output-Sensitive Enumeration of Potential Maximal Cliques in Polynomial Space","Caroline Brosse, Alessio Conte, Vincent Limouzy, Giulia Punzi, Davide Rucci","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","A set of vertices in a graph forms a potential maximal clique if there exists a minimal chordal completion in which it is a maximal clique. Potential maximal cliques were first introduced as a key tool to obtain an efficient, though exponential-time algorithm to compute the treewidth of a graph. As a byproduct, this allowed to compute the treewidth of various graph classes in polynomial time. In recent years, the concept of potential maximal cliques regained interest as it proved to be useful for a handful of graph algorithmic problems. In particular, it turned out to be a key tool to obtain a polynomial time algorithm for computing maximum weight independent sets in $P_5$-free and $P_6$-free graphs (Lokshtanov et al., SODA `14 and Grzeskik et al., SODA `19. In most of their applications, obtaining all the potential maximal cliques constitutes an algorithmic bottleneck, thus motivating the question of how to efficiently enumerate all the potential maximal cliques in a graph $G$. The state-of-the-art algorithm by Bouchitt√© \& Todinca can enumerate potential maximal cliques in output-polynomial time by using exponential space, a significant limitation for the size of feasible instances. In this paper, we revisit this algorithm and design an enumeration algorithm that preserves an output-polynomial time complexity while only requiring polynomial space.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 11:53:26 UTC (41 KB)"
"143","Max-Cut with $Œµ$-Accurate Predictions","Vincent Cohen-Addad, Tommaso d'Orsi, Anupam Gupta, Euiwoong Lee, Debmalya Panigrahi","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We study the approximability of the MaxCut problem in the presence of predictions. Specifically, we consider two models: in the noisy predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label in $\{-1,+1\}$ with some unknown probability $1/2 + \epsilon$, and the other (incorrect) label otherwise. In the more-informative partial predictions model, for each vertex we are given its correct label with probability $\epsilon$ and no label otherwise. We assume only pairwise independence between vertices in both models. We show how these predictions can be used to improve on the worst-case approximation ratios for this problem. Specifically, we give an algorithm that achieves an $\alpha + \widetilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^4)$-approximation for the noisy predictions model, where $\alpha \approx 0.878$ is the MaxCut threshold. While this result also holds for the partial predictions model, we can also give a $\beta + \Omega(\epsilon)$-approximation, where $\beta \approx 0.858$ is the approximation ratio for MaxBisection given by Raghavendra and Tan. This answers a question posed by Ola Svensson in his plenary session talk at SODA'23.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 11:51:28 UTC (34 KB)"
"144","Lower Bounds for Leaf Rank of Leaf Powers","Svein H√∏gemo","Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)","Leaf powers and $k$-leaf powers have been studied for over 20 years, but there are still several aspects of this graph class that are poorly understood. One such aspect is the leaf rank of leaf powers, i.e. the smallest number $k$ such that a graph $G$ is a $k$-leaf power. Computing the leaf rank of leaf powers has proved a hard task, and furthermore, results about the asymptotic growth of the leaf rank as a function of the number of vertices in the graph have been few and far between. We present an infinite family of rooted directed path graphs that are leaf powers, and prove that they have leaf rank exponential in the number of vertices (utilizing a type of subtree model first presented by Rautenbach [Some remarks about leaf roots. Discrete mathematics, 2006]). This answers an open question by Brandst√§dt et al. [Rooted directed path graphs are leaf powers. Discrete mathematics, 2010].","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 11:18:16 UTC (224 KB)"

We focus on non-trivial MAWs which are of length at least 2. Finding such non-trivial MAWs for a given string is motivated for applications in bioinformatics and data compression. Fujishige et al. [TCS 2023] proposed a data structure of size $\Theta(n)$ that can output the set $\mathsf{MAW}(S)$ of all MAWs for a given string $S$ of length $n$ in $O(n + |\mathsf{MAW}(S)|)$ time, based on the directed acyclic word graph (DAWG). In this paper, we present a more space efficient data structure based on the compact DAWG (CDAWG), which can output $\mathsf{MAW}(S)$ in $O(|\mathsf{MAW}(S)|)$ time with $O(e)$ space, where $e$ denotes the minimum of the sizes of the CDAWGs for $S$ and for its reversal $S^R$. For any strings of length $n$, it holds that $e < 2n$, and for highly repetitive strings $e$ can be sublinear (up to logarithmic) in $n$. We also show that MAWs and their generalization minimal rare words have close relationships with extended bispecial factors, via the CDAWG.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 06:22:24 UTC (1,727 KB)"
"146","Tighter Bounds for Local Differentially Private Core Decomposition and Densest Subgraph","Monika Henzinger, A. R. Sricharan, Leqi Zhu","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Computing the core decomposition of a graph is a fundamental problem that has recently been studied in the differentially private setting, motivated by practical applications in data mining. In particular, Dhulipala et al. [FOCS 2022] gave the first mechanism for approximate core decomposition in the challenging and practically relevant setting of local differential privacy. One of the main open problems left by their work is whether the accuracy, i.e., the approximation ratio and additive error, of their mechanism can be improved. We show the first lower bounds on the additive error of approximate and exact core decomposition mechanisms in the centralized and local model of differential privacy, respectively. We also give mechanisms for exact and approximate core decomposition in the local model, with almost matching additive error bounds. Our mechanisms are based on a black-box application of continual counting. They also yield improved mechanisms for the approximate densest subgraph problem in the local model.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 03:30:31 UTC (113 KB)"
"147","A Compact Anomaly Detection Solution for Science Instruments","Alfonso Lagares de Toledo, Christopher E. Carr","Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)","Small low-cost instruments enable new and exciting mission opportunities yet their constrained volume and limited budgets make them especially susceptible to suffering anomalies during flight. Radiation effects as well as sensor or actuator failure can all pose a serious threat to the continued collection of scientific data as well as cause the partial or complete loss of a mission science payload. Onboard anomaly detection could allow instruments to recover from such events but its ad hoc development typically falls outside the mission timeline or monetary constraints. Here we describe a compact solution for the implementation of onboard anomaly detection meant for space science missions. The device is designed to be interoperable with a broad range of instruments utilizing easily accessible power and logic signals to monitor the state of peripherals and actuators without disrupting their functionality. By leveraging a commercially available microcontroller with a radiation hardened alternative package the device can be inexpensively sourced and assembled with minimal work enabling instrument characterization on an expedited timeline. The system can then be exchanged for a radiation hardened version ensuring the replicability of observed anomalies in a laboratory environment during instrument operations. We also present currently implemented anomaly detection algorithms which enable the system to detect anomalies in instruments with varying failure modes and allow mission designers to choose which detection approach best fits the specific needs of their instrument. Finally, we showcase an example application of this system in the detection of anomalies during the operation of a lysis motor designed for use in biological space instruments.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 01:00:49 UTC (4,537 KB)"
"148","Decremental $(1+Œµ)$-Approximate Maximum Eigenvector: Dynamic Power Method","Deeksha Adil, Thatchaphol Saranurak","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We present a dynamic algorithm for maintaining $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate maximum eigenvector and eigenvalue of a positive semi-definite matrix $A$ undergoing \emph{decreasing} updates, i.e., updates which may only decrease eigenvalues. Given a vector $v$ updating $A\gets A-vv^{\top}$, our algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(v))$ amortized update time, i.e., polylogarithmic per non-zeros in the update vector. Our technique is based on a novel analysis of the influential power method in the dynamic setting. The two previous sets of techniques have the following drawbacks (1) algebraic techniques can maintain exact solutions but their update time is at least polynomial per non-zeros, and (2) sketching techniques admit polylogarithmic update time but suffer from a crude additive approximation. Our algorithm exploits an oblivious adversary. Interestingly, we show that any algorithm with polylogarithmic update time per non-zeros that works against an adaptive adversary and satisfies an additional natural property would imply a breakthrough for checking psd-ness of matrices in $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ time, instead of $O(n^{\omega})$ time.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 23:04:28 UTC (69 KB)"
"149","Robustly Learning Single-Index Models via Alignment Sharpness","Nikos Zarifis, Puqian Wang, Ilias Diakonikolas, Jelena Diakonikolas","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We study the problem of learning Single-Index Models under the $L_2^2$ loss in the agnostic model. We give an efficient learning algorithm, achieving a constant factor approximation to the optimal loss, that succeeds under a range of distributions (including log-concave distributions) and a broad class of monotone and Lipschitz link functions. This is the first efficient constant factor approximate agnostic learner, even for Gaussian data and for any nontrivial class of link functions. Prior work for the case of unknown link function either works in the realizable setting or does not attain constant factor approximation. The main technical ingredient enabling our algorithm and analysis is a novel notion of a local error bound in optimization that we term alignment sharpness and that may be of broader interest.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:48:07 UTC (290 KB)"
"150","Learning-Based Algorithms for Graph Searching Problems","Adela Frances DePavia, Erasmo Tani, Ali Vakilian","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We consider the problem of graph searching with prediction recently introduced by Banerjee et al. (2022). In this problem, an agent, starting at some vertex $r$ has to traverse a (potentially unknown) graph $G$ to find a hidden goal node $g$ while minimizing the total distance travelled. We study a setting in which at any node $v$, the agent receives a noisy estimate of the distance from $v$ to $g$. We design algorithms for this search task on unknown graphs. We establish the first formal guarantees on unknown weighted graphs and provide lower bounds showing that the algorithms we propose have optimal or nearly-optimal dependence on the prediction error. Further, we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in addition to being robust to adversarial error, our algorithms perform well in typical instances in which the error is stochastic. Finally, we provide alternative simpler performance bounds on the algorithms of Banerjee et al. (2022) for the case of searching on a known graph, and establish new lower bounds for this setting.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:12:58 UTC (978 KB)"
