    These are super sliders, good value. Unfortunately size 13 but not wide enough for my husband’s broad feet. However, my grandson is delighted with them!

    Adidas slider sandals: ""Adilette Aqua"" FY8047; SIZE 9UK &US; FR 43; JP 275; CHN 265. Made in Vietnam. New, original, in sealed bag with QR & BAR CODES factory stickers, & ADIDAS Hanger. Sold & delivered by Amazon UK, at a welcome discount. The Mrs & I have had items, such as clothes, (and even a 2016 MICROSOFT 640XL, which still works well for calls & SMS, and calculations) made in Vietnam; and found their quality control high. * A light blue, with white stripes across the instep, which, I realised would suit a neighbour, as they match his Fiat 500 - so I really should show them to him! There is enclosed a long list, on a small card, of 21 activities, which the sandals are suitable for - including walking, cycling, golf, & swimming - but not for bobsleighing, before anyone asks! These are of a strong build quality, & a good fit across the instep; & leave a generous gap of around 3cm, front & rear, which I require as a buffer zone for my toes & heals (my normal size is UK 9.) CONCLUSION: Recommended on quality for the price. If, like myself, you can be a bit clumsy, with a long history of broken crockery and glasses; and I  never want to walk again into an abandoned wooden pallet - in flip flops, - I also recommend your choosing your usual shoe size, as a generous fit, or one size up! ❗ UPDATE: mid-July 2023. I have sunk into the sole of the sandals, as per the shape of my feet. I recently saw a young man  in a park in Nike sliders, who had sunk further into his, than I; likely, he paid a lot more for his! *In comparison, the chunky Mrs has not sunk into her genuine CROCS (See my Review.) They were on offer; and I ordered a pair of unattractive White ones, on price, and minus the badge, but they were waaaay too big, even with socks on. So, I recommend the CROCS, if on offer, and if you order one size up, which worked for her. If on a firm budget, seems only the company name is the difference with the competition. The Mrs is very pleased with her CROCS, so, then, I am not subject to her kicking them off in my direction!

    The Adidas slippers I purchased on Amazon have been a delightful addition to my daily routine. Though a bit pricey, they prove to be worth every penny. The perfect fit for my size adds to the overall comfort. I find myself using them daily around the house or for quick local outings, and they've been a game-changer. What's particularly impressive is how they resist getting dirty easily, maintaining their sleek appearance. Despite the initial cost, the durability, comfort, and style make these Adidas slippers a valuable investment that I'm happy to have made.

    These Adidas slippers would have been perfect if they had of fitted correctly! They are a lot smaller than they should be! I had ordered a size 10 for my son but they were more like a size 8/9! But other than that they are fine. These are obviously NOT the Brand make of Adidas! So if ordering bear this in mind, and order up in size. They are good value for money if you are looking for a budget slider!

    Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend to replace his old ones. They fit him perfectly although appear a lot smaller than his old ones, though appearing quite narrow they still fit his wide feet. They are made of a strong and high quality material which will hopefully last the same time or longer than his old pair which were also Adidas brand and pretty sure he had them for 8+ years. These are definitely great as easy to put on slides in the house and quick trips outside as well. They are fully rubber so also fully waterproof.

    I like the colour I like the design and a comfort but they do come up very narrow. I usually wear size 8 couldn't even get into those. if you plan it to wear them like a flip-flop ie no socks, then one size up will do but if you're planning to wear socks with it as seems to be the fashion at the moment you probably need to go up another size. Beat on mind this is the aqua version.That said even a size up the left is very tight the right is fine. Usually it is the other way around for me. And I checked and has size 9 embossed.

    Hi. Just wanted to give quick impression on these flip flops.First of all the size. I put up photos that hopfully will help someone. I take exactly a size UK 8, but with these i took other reviewers advice and ordered a size Uk 9 (one size up from my norm)  I found that, if you look close at the photos, there is an indent/impression of a foot shape with toe grooves on the inside sole of the shoe. I found this part (the whole length of indent)  from indent heal to indent toe on the size 9 shoe, to be exactly a size UK 8, which leaves about half an inch front and back bettween my foot and the ends of shoe. Which is perfect. So if i had bought my normal size (size UK8) it would have been to small my foot would have been right up to both ends, whith no spare room. So i would recommend if you know your exact size, order a size up from that. ( sorry if this is all a bit confusing, lol, but its quite hard to explain/ Photos show it better)As for the shoe itself, for 12 pounds, i feel is an ok price for what they are. I only bought mine to use at the swimming pool, for use going to and from changing rooms, and for that purpose they are just fine. I do wear them around the house a little, but for me i wouldnt wear them full time, as i have quite wide feet and  find them a little tight on the band area. But this could just be because they are new im sure they will loosen over time, and it is not tight as in hurting, just a bit to much pressure for my liking, but i do have a touch arthritis in my toes, so that why the slight pressure bothers me. The soles are firm but soft enough, not squishy, i wouldnt want to walk any great distance in them, but they are not uncomfortable either.Overall, for the price they are just fine nothing special and nothing bad. For what i bought them for (use at swimming pool and popping in and out to the garden etc they are just fine and i wouldnt recommend them For wearing all day and using as your main footwear, in that scenario i would maybe spend more and get something more padded and comfy.As for longevity i cant say as yet, as i only had them a week, but they seem sturdy and well enough made.Anyways, hope this helps someone and any further questions feel free to ask.UPDATE: Just been using them for over a week. I originally said that i personally found them a little tight over the toes/foot, but i take that back now, they have loosend a little and top strap has molded to the shape of my foot. so all is good. no pressure on the top of my foot and they are nice and comfy :)All the best, Take care and stay safe. G :)

    These weren't what I was expecting. I am a size 10 and ordered the right size, they were very tight and uncomfortable to wear. I would suggest ordering a size above as to not be disappointed. Otherwise, very light and easy to clean.

    When your feet are soaking wet these are great to wear in place of your slippers until you dry off.  Not sure about the durability as I haven't had them long enough but they seem durable.

But this could just be because they are new im sure they will loosen over time, and it is not tight as in hurting, just a bit to much pressure for my liking, but i do have a touch arthritis in my toes, so that why the slight pressure bothers me. The soles are firm but soft enough, not squishy, i wouldnt want to walk any great distance in them, but they are not uncomfortable either.Overall, for the price they are just fine nothing special and nothing bad. For what i bought them for (use at swimming pool and popping in and out to the garden etc they are just fine and i wouldnt recommend them For wearing all day and using as your main footwear, in that scenario i would maybe spend more and get something more padded and comfy.As for longevity i cant say as yet, as i only had them a week, but they seem sturdy and well enough made.Anyways, hope this helps someone and any further questions feel free to ask.UPDATE: Just been using them for over a week. I originally said that i personally found them a little tight over the toes/foot, but i take that back now, they have loosend a little and top strap has molded to the shape of my foot. so all is good. no pressure on the top of my foot and they are nice and comfy :)All the best, Take care and stay safe.

    Hi. Just wanted to give quick impression on these flip flops.First of all the size. I put up photos that hopfully will help someone. I take exactly a size UK 8, but with these i took other reviewers advice and ordered a size Uk 9 (one size up from my norm)  I found that, if you look close at the photos, there is an indent/impression of a foot shape with toe grooves on the inside sole of the shoe. I found this part (the whole length of indent)  from indent heal to indent toe on the size 9 shoe, to be exactly a size UK 8, which leaves about half an inch front and back bettween my foot and the ends of shoe. Which is perfect. So if i had bought my normal size (size UK8) it would have been to small my foot would have been right up to both ends, whith no spare room. So i would recommend if you know your exact size, order a size up from that. ( sorry if this is all a bit confusing, lol, but its quite hard to explain/ Photos show it better)As for the shoe itself, for 12 pounds, i feel is an ok price for what they are. I only bought mine to use at the swimming pool, for use going to and from changing rooms, and for that purpose they are just fine. I do wear them around the house a little, but for me i wouldnt wear them full time, as i have quite wide feet and  find them a little tight on the band area. But this could just be because they are new im sure they will loosen over time, and it is not tight as in hurting, just a bit to much pressure for my liking, but i do have a touch arthritis in my toes, so that why the slight pressure bothers me.

    Adidas slider sandals: ""Adilette Aqua"" FY8047; SIZE 9UK &US; FR 43; JP 275; CHN 265. Made in Vietnam. New, original, in sealed bag with QR & BAR CODES factory stickers, & ADIDAS Hanger. Sold & delivered by Amazon UK, at a welcome discount. The Mrs & I have had items, such as clothes, (and even a 2016 MICROSOFT 640XL, which still works well for calls & SMS, and calculations) made in Vietnam; and found their quality control high. * A light blue, with white stripes across the instep, which, I realised would suit a neighbour, as they match his Fiat 500 - so I really should show them to him! There is enclosed a long list, on a small card, of 21 activities, which the sandals are suitable for - including walking, cycling, golf, & swimming - but not for bobsleighing, before anyone asks! These are of a strong build quality, & a good fit across the instep; & leave a generous gap of around 3cm, front & rear, which I require as a buffer zone for my toes & heals (my normal size is UK 9.) CONCLUSION: Recommended on quality for the price. If, like myself, you can be a bit clumsy, with a long history of broken crockery and glasses; and I  never want to walk again into an abandoned wooden pallet - in flip flops, - I also recommend your choosing your usual shoe size, as a generous fit, or one size up! ❗ UPDATE: mid-July 2023. I have sunk into the sole of the sandals, as per the shape of my feet. I recently saw a young man  in a park in Nike sliders, who had sunk further into his, than I; likely, he paid a lot more for his! *In comparison, the chunky Mrs has not sunk into her genuine CROCS (See my Review.) They were on offer; and I ordered a pair of unattractive White ones, on price, and minus the badge, but they were waaaay too big, even with socks on. So, I recommend the CROCS, if on offer, and if you order one size up, which worked for her. If on a firm budget, seems only the company name is the difference with the competition. The Mrs is very pleased with her CROCS, so, then, I am not subject to her kicking them off in my direction!

    The Adidas slippers I purchased on Amazon have been a delightful addition to my daily routine. Though a bit pricey, they prove to be worth every penny. The perfect fit for my size adds to the overall comfort. I find myself using them daily around the house or for quick local outings, and they've been a game-changer. What's particularly impressive is how they resist getting dirty easily, maintaining their sleek appearance. Despite the initial cost, the durability, comfort, and style make these Adidas slippers a valuable investment that I'm happy to have made.

    These Adidas slippers would have been perfect if they had of fitted correctly! They are a lot smaller than they should be! I had ordered a size 10 for my son but they were more like a size 8/9! But other than that they are fine. These are obviously NOT the Brand make of Adidas! So if ordering bear this in mind, and order up in size. They are good value for money if you are looking for a budget slider!

    Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend to replace his old ones. They fit him perfectly although appear a lot smaller than his old ones, though appearing quite narrow they still fit his wide feet. They are made of a strong and high quality material which will hopefully last the same time or longer than his old pair which were also Adidas brand and pretty sure he had them for 8+ years. These are definitely great as easy to put on slides in the house and quick trips outside as well. They are fully rubber so also fully waterproof.

    I like the colour I like the design and a comfort but they do come up very narrow. I usually wear size 8 couldn't even get into those. if you plan it to wear them like a flip-flop ie no socks, then one size up will do but if you're planning to wear socks with it as seems to be the fashion at the moment you probably need to go up another size. Beat on mind this is the aqua version.That said even a size up the left is very tight the right is fine. Usually it is the other way around for me. And I checked and has size 9 embossed.

    These Adidas slippers would have been perfect if they had of fitted correctly! They are a lot smaller than they should be! I had ordered a size 10 for my son but they were more like a size 8/9! But other than that they are fine. These are obviously NOT the Brand make of Adidas! So if ordering bear this in mind, and order up in size. They are good value for money if you are looking for a budget slider!

    These are lovely to wear. Comfortable and soft soled. The actual slip on is as light as a feather. They are weightless. I'm delighted with them

    Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend to replace his old ones. They fit him perfectly although appear a lot smaller than his old ones, though appearing quite narrow they still fit his wide feet. They are made of a strong and high quality material which will hopefully last the same time or longer than his old pair which were also Adidas brand and pretty sure he had them for 8+ years. These are definitely great as easy to put on slides in the house and quick trips outside as well. They are fully rubber so also fully waterproof.

    I like the colour I like the design and a comfort but they do come up very narrow. I usually wear size 8 couldn't even get into those. if you plan it to wear them like a flip-flop ie no socks, then one size up will do but if you're planning to wear socks with it as seems to be the fashion at the moment you probably need to go up another size. Beat on mind this is the aqua version.That said even a size up the left is very tight the right is fine. Usually it is the other way around for me. And I checked and has size 9 embossed.

    I only wanted a cheap pair of sliders due to a foot injury, and the fact, I am not a slider wearing person. So looking on Amazon I clicked on low priced items only to find that once you put in your shoe size and colour, the price goes up to stupid prices. So I was more than happy when I found these ones for just over £10. They fit nicely are comfortable to wear and with vent holes, allow air to circulate.  I am happy with this purchase. EVC

    I have to say the sizing on Crocs are very well out , i am a size UK 8 in everyday shoes / trainers ( Mens ) so EU size would be 42 though if you order a UK 8 you then receive EU 42 - 43 which will be UK size 8 to 9 so a size up . then you again have the problem because if you order UK 7 they are EU 41 - 42 thus making them a UK 7 to 8 very confusing ..If you are a half size you maybe ok but i ordered the UK 7 but being a UK 8 they were slightly tight as in the EU sizing they would be EU 41 - 42 aka UK 7 to 8 but if you upsize they could be lose as the sizes go up an extra size ..I personally would recommend purchasing two pairs one being your regular size and one size down as these are in-between sizes if that makes sense , never buy a size larger as they would be two sizes to large and way to big ... Though order your everyday shoe size and you should be fine but people saying order a size up must have blisters from the room and rubbing on the top of their footThey are good sliders and the bonus you can jazz them up , also they are comfy ... People do not like crocs clogs so if you want crocs without the hate for the clog's then these are the ones ... I will say i had these on a good offer and would purchase again ..I hope the above sizing helps as these are two sizes rather than one , i go off EU sizing but measure your feet is also easy ... Place your foot on an a4 piece of paper and place your heel tightly against the wall or skirting board and mark where your largest toe ends and compare the size chart , hope this helps :)*EDITAs so comfy i have the White , Navy and Black and soon the Blue ... I find these are better than the dreaded clogs and are better than more expensive brands ...Sizing is the flaw but hope above helped

    I wanted to buy a new pair of pool / spa sliders for my upcoming holiday but can't abide wearing flip-flops because of the toe-posts. As I already own a few pairs of Crocs (different models such as Cleo etc), I knew I would probably be happy with their basic (classic) sliders. I also knew from previous ordering experiences that, usually taking a size 5 in barefoot shoes, I would need to order Crocs' (US) size m5/w7.Having received the sliders a couple of days ago, I find my sizing choice perfect, the width of the sliders ideal for medium-width feet, and find them very comfortable and lightweight to wear. Happy holidays.

    I have to say the sizing on Crocs are very well out , i am a size UK 8 in everyday shoes / trainers ( Mens ) so EU size would be 42 though if you order a UK 8 you then receive EU 42 - 43 which will be UK size 8 to 9 so a size up . then you again have the problem because if you order UK 7 they are EU 41 - 42 thus making them a UK 7 to 8 very confusing ..If you are a half size you maybe ok but i ordered the UK 7 but being a UK 8 they were slightly tight as in the EU sizing they would be EU 41 - 42 aka UK 7 to 8 but if you upsize they could be lose as the sizes go up an extra size ..I personally would recommend purchasing two pairs one being your regular size and one size down as these are in-between sizes if that makes sense , never buy a size larger as they would be two sizes to large and way to big ... Though order your everyday shoe size and you should be fine but people saying order a size up must have blisters from the room and rubbing on the top of their footThey are good sliders and the bonus you can jazz them up , also they are comfy ... People do not like crocs clogs so if you want crocs without the hate for the clog's then these are the ones ... I will say i had these on a good offer and would purchase again ..I hope the above sizing helps as these are two sizes rather than one , i go off EU sizing but measure your feet is also easy ... Place your foot on an a4 piece of paper and place your heel tightly against the wall or skirting board and mark where your largest toe ends and compare the size chart , hope this helps :)*EDITAs so comfy i have the White , Navy and Black and soon the Blue ... I find these are better than the dreaded clogs and are better than more expensive brands ...Sizing is the flaw but hope above helped

    I gave these a 4 star as they are really nice & the comfiest pair of sliders I own.However, i purchased a black pair.  The pic on Amazon showed a white croc logo on the front. Mine have not got that ?They did come in a crocs plastic bag & tags though? I can't imagine Amazon selling fake crocs ? Having never owned a pair of crocs I'm not sure if they all have the logo on the front ?

    I wanted to buy a new pair of pool / spa sliders for my upcoming holiday but can't abide wearing flip-flops because of the toe-posts. As I already own a few pairs of Crocs (different models such as Cleo etc), I knew I would probably be happy with their basic (classic) sliders. I also knew from previous ordering experiences that, usually taking a size 5 in barefoot shoes, I would need to order Crocs' (US) size m5/w7.Having received the sliders a couple of days ago, I find my sizing choice perfect, the width of the sliders ideal for medium-width feet, and find them very comfortable and lightweight to wear. Happy holidays.

    I can't sing enough praises for this moisturiser. It's a game-changer in my skincare routine, earning a solid 5 out of 5 stars from me.Applying this moisturiser feels like a breath of fresh air for my skin. It's incredibly refreshing and instantly revitalizes my complexion. This is exactly what I look for in a moisturiser - that invigorating, rejuvenating feel.Beyond the sensory experience, it delivers on all fronts. It does precisely what a moisturiser is meant to do, providing long-lasting hydration without any greasy residue. My skin feels balanced, nourished, and soft after every application.I lucked out with a bundle deal, which made the purchase even sweeter. The value for money is exceptional, especially considering the high-quality ingredients and the fantastic results I've experienced.This isn't my first dance with The INKEY List, and their products consistently impress me. Their commitment to effective, affordable skincare is commendable. I've tried a few other items from their range, and each one has exceeded my expectations.In a nutshell, if you're on the hunt for a top-notch moisturiser, this one is the way to go. It's refreshing, effective, and the bundle deal is the cherry on top. I can't recommend it highly enough!

    I like the texture of this moisturiser and it seems to do the job well - I prefer it to the Inkey Peptide moisturiser for its texture and application. However, the product smells awful, the best description I can come up with is a sort of chemical potato odour. The smell doesn’t last but I do have to gird my loins every time I open the tube. I also find the Inkey moisturiser tubes very annoying to use, but that is a side note to the smell.

    I live in New England and once the summer changes to fall and the humidity goes, I have a tendency to develop major dry patches on my face. I've tried so many creams and lotions that I've lost count. Have a drawer full that either just didn't help or irritated my skin further.This one works really well and can quell the dryness in just a couple of uses. It also doesn't burn or sting when put on raw sensitive skin. Although the tube has much less product than the tub, it's easy to keep the tube in my purse so I have it all the time.I find that I can use this under foundation with no pilling.

    After incorporating CeraVe Moisturising Cream into my daily skincare routine, I am compelled to award it a well-deserved 5-star review for its exceptional performance in tackling dry skin.The cream's effectiveness lies in its unique formula.

    I love this cream. I used the Cerave lotion for years but due to using Tretinoin my skin was in much need of some serious TLC. This is so much better than the lotion for dry skin - I use it in the morning and at night as I found it doesn't make my skin greasy or oily (I have combination skin with an oily T zone).I layer this over my morning serums or over Tretinoin at night after letting it soak in for 30mins or so. It has no scent, it didn't make me break out and my skin isn't dry anymore despite the cold and windy weather. I love it!

    I have very dry sensetive skin and this is the only face cream that works. Been using it for several years. Hydration lasts all day.I did notice it is way cheaper to buy it on Amazon than in store (like Boots or similar if you're in the UK).The consistency is thicker than lotion but not heavy or greasy at all. However, when applying on the skin, rather than being fully absorbed it almost sets on top of the skin in a thin layer, almost like Vaseline. If you were to drag your fingernail across your face, you'd scrape some product off - and I wouldn't say it's because I apply too much. This consistency works for me as the layer almost acts as a protective barrier for my dry skin, but I know many people who don't enjoy it, so beware.it works well under my NYX full coverage foundation that's meant to stick and set on the face, but not so much with more light/dewy make up, starts to peel a bit. The thick consistency of the cream almost evens out the skin texture buy filling in any indents or pores of the face.

    First of all, this is a huge tub of moisturizer that will last a very long time. Although it probably won't eliminate any wrinkles, it does hydrate and prevent dry skin from the effects of winter heating. I am 77 years old and have had a problem with my legs getting flaky after bathing in the winter. I have been using this cream and have not had any flaking in my legs. In fact, my legs feel silky and smooth even at my age. I don't expect this cream to eliminate loose or sagging skin at my age. It's just good to help and protect the skin that I have.This cream has little to no odor. I use it on most of my legs, arms, stomach, etc. after a bath and it absorbs into my skin instantly. There is absolutely no greasy or oily feeling. As yet, I haven't used this cream on my face as I have others that I use. As a body cream, I prefer this one over others I have used in the past.I hope this review was helpful for you.

It has no scent, it didn't make me break out and my skin isn't dry anymore despite the cold and windy weather. I love it!

    This is the best moisturiser I have found and works better than other leading brands such as E45 and Nivea. It is also usually slightly cheaper on Amazon compared to other high street stores

    I have very dry sensetive skin and this is the only face cream that works. Been using it for several years. Hydration lasts all day.I did notice it is way cheaper to buy it on Amazon than in store (like Boots or similar if you're in the UK).The consistency is thicker than lotion but not heavy or greasy at all. However, when applying on the skin, rather than being fully absorbed it almost sets on top of the skin in a thin layer, almost like Vaseline. If you were to drag your fingernail across your face, you'd scrape some product off - and I wouldn't say it's because I apply too much. This consistency works for me as the layer almost acts as a protective barrier for my dry skin, but I know many people who don't enjoy it, so beware.it works well under my NYX full coverage foundation that's meant to stick and set on the face, but not so much with more light/dewy make up, starts to peel a bit. The thick consistency of the cream almost evens out the skin texture buy filling in any indents or pores of the face.

    I have never used this brand before so trusted the other reviews.I used to use Nivea but needed something more intensive for my maturing skin (age 45)I've been using it a week and the difference in my skin has improved alot.Feels smoother & more plump/supple.Great size pot for the cost compared to the 50ml jars I was purchasingFast deliveryThanks

    First of all, this is a huge tub of moisturizer that will last a very long time. Although it probably won't eliminate any wrinkles, it does hydrate and prevent dry skin from the effects of winter heating. I am 77 years old and have had a problem with my legs getting flaky after bathing in the winter. I have been using this cream and have not had any flaking in my legs. In fact, my legs feel silky and smooth even at my age. I don't expect this cream to eliminate loose or sagging skin at my age. It's just good to help and protect the skin that I have.This cream has little to no odor. I use it on most of my legs, arms, stomach, etc. after a bath and it absorbs into my skin instantly. There is absolutely no greasy or oily feeling. As yet, I haven't used this cream on my face as I have others that I use. As a body cream, I prefer this one over others I have used in the past.I hope this review was helpful for you.

    I bought this product while it was on offer because my usual buy from b**y shop was steadily creeping up and wasn't as good quality as normal. I took a chance and was very happy. Once you get over the slimy texture which is obviously to be expected considering the name and becomes irrelevant when you realise what an amazing product this is! It takes tiny amounts that go a long long way to rejuvenate your skin. My face is greasy on the T zone and chin area but dry everywhere else. This is the only product I can use all over my face with even results. It isn't greasy at all. Doesn't leave your face shiny at all and almost looks drying without feeling it. It soaks in fast and leaves skin soft and subtle without being moist looking. I use the essence as well. It also goes a long way. It is the perfect prep and not slimy like the moisturiser. It's important to tap it into your skin rather than rub it to help hydrate before the moisturiser. Over all I took a chance venturing out to a different product and wasn't disappointed. Amazing

    I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I am 50 yrs young, going through perimenopause and my facial tone has seen better days.Ok so We all know that stress. Environmental elements can affect your physical, mental, emotional health, especially aging women that don't take care of their older skin. You if don't take care of yourself.I have tried pretty much every skin care regimen that a woman can possibly try. As stated above, I am 50 years old. I still have breakouts from time to time. I have broken red capillaries on my face. I have large poors. I have wrinkles.  Don't get me started on finding a great foundation. I haven't found that yet but anyways. I ordered this product and I was not for sure about what to expect just by the pure name of it. LOL but I ordered it along with a couple of the other skin care products from the same brand.  And I immediately washed my face and used my little shaver to exfoliate and get rid of the fuzzies and applied everything that I bought including this product and my face felt immediately 10 times better, it was almost kind of instant the redness went away.  The appearance of my pores was very minimal. My face looked shiny, kinda rejuvenated. It's not oily, it's really slick. It's very viscous, slimy consistency.  There is no smell, it's not grainy, it is whitish in color goes on clear rubs right in it takes a minute for it to dry on your face so it's kind of I wanna say tacky, but after it dries on your face, it feels really smooth and it's almost kinda like it tightens your face when it dries, so that was kind of a nice effect.  So when it dries on your face and it tightens like it did, I almost felt like it tightened the pores on my face. So that was a good indication that it was kind of smoothing out the appearance of the large pores that I have.Overall, I would suggest buying this despite the weirdness of it.  It's good I have extremely sensitive skin. I have T zone area so I'm part dry part oily. I get a bit of psoriasis or eczema behind my ears or whatever and around my nose and my laugh lines are super sensitive to different products, especially Vitamin C products which I will never buy again.  But my face gets Super dry and flaky. And this product did not do that at all. No burn effect either. Exceeded my expectations overall. I'm very happy with my purchase and I will leave reviews for the other products that I bought from this brand on the other pages.

    Tenía muchas expectativas del producto ya que es coreano y vi muchas reseñas.Y sin duda, es lo mejor que he probado, mi piel es sensible con tendencia  mixta-grasa, los primeros cambios que vi es que no irrita la piel para nada, no es pesada al contrario, la textura es muy ligera y sin duda, súper hidratante para mi piel. De hecho hasta se redujo muchísimo el brillo producido por la grasa que produce mi piel. Además, disminuyeron considerablemente la aparición de granitos y por supuesto, los poros. ¡Lo recomiendo sin duda, es una maravilla!

    I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I am 50 yrs young, going through perimenopause and my facial tone has seen better days.Ok so We all know that stress. Environmental elements can affect your physical, mental, emotional health, especially aging women that don't take care of their older skin. You if don't take care of yourself.I have tried pretty much every skin care regimen that a woman can possibly try. As stated above, I am 50 years old. I still have breakouts from time to time. I have broken red capillaries on my face. I have large poors. I have wrinkles.  Don't get me started on finding a great foundation. I haven't found that yet but anyways. I ordered this product and I was not for sure about what to expect just by the pure name of it. LOL but I ordered it along with a couple of the other skin care products from the same brand.  And I immediately washed my face and used my little shaver to exfoliate and get rid of the fuzzies and applied everything that I bought including this product and my face felt immediately 10 times better, it was almost kind of instant the redness went away.  The appearance of my pores was very minimal. My face looked shiny, kinda rejuvenated. It's not oily, it's really slick. It's very viscous, slimy consistency.  There is no smell, it's not grainy, it is whitish in color goes on clear rubs right in it takes a minute for it to dry on your face so it's kind of I wanna say tacky, but after it dries on your face, it feels really smooth and it's almost kinda like it tightens your face when it dries, so that was kind of a nice effect.  So when it dries on your face and it tightens like it did, I almost felt like it tightened the pores on my face. So that was a good indication that it was kind of smoothing out the appearance of the large pores that I have.Overall, I would suggest buying this despite the weirdness of it.  It's good I have extremely sensitive skin. I have T zone area so I'm part dry part oily. I get a bit of psoriasis or eczema behind my ears or whatever and around my nose and my laugh lines are super sensitive to different products, especially Vitamin C products which I will never buy again.  But my face gets Super dry and flaky. And this product did not do that at all. No burn effect either. Exceeded my expectations overall. I'm very happy with my purchase and I will leave reviews for the other products that I bought from this brand on the other pages.

    My partner and I love Aveeno. We both have very sensitive skin, particularly during cold weather. We both also suffer from sensory issues caused by most hand creams leaving residue on our hands. Aveeno, particularly this product, is perfect for us - it helps moisturize our hands, is mostly unscented, and soaks in quickly, allowing us to continue with our daily lives without anything slipping from our grip! We have a bottle in every room in our apartment, so to discover there is now a 500ml variant felt like Christmas came early!

    I have been using Aveeno Moisturising Body Lotion for a few years now and bought it from Amazon for the convenience - it’s a game-changer for me. Working in healthcare I have to wash my hands lots and whilst I’d describe most of my skin as ‘normal’, my hands are very dry and find this work wonders at restoring them to healthy skin again. Using it elsewhere makes my skin extra soft also. I like that it’s fragrance-free, it’s perfect for those with a sensitivity to scents, like me - particularly on my hands! The 500ml size is generous and lasts me for months. It provides long-lasting moisture but doesn’t feel greasy.

    Honestly love applying this product to my face after using cleanser. Feels lovely and my skin hasn't been breaking out as much since using it over the CeraVe one I had been using.Honestly, there's a newer version that is 'vanilla and oats' scented which I buy in person (not sure if i can leave a review for it on here because of it) - but as a guy it's one of the highlights of my day applying it to my face in the evening as the scent is just sublime and always brings a smile to my face :)I definitely recommend the main product in this review before trying to vanilla one as I think the latter may be a little more expensive :)
